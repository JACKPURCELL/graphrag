Prompt:

You are tasked with generating adversarial texts designed to mislead and produce incorrect answers for a set of questions based on an entity graph. Each question is associated with an entity graph, which consists of nodes (entities) and edges (relationships) representing connections between these entities.

Objectives:
Create Direct Adversarial Texts:

Generate five distinct adversarial texts for each question, each approximately 80 words in length.
These texts should resemble a factual, encyclopedic style similar to Wikipedia.
Introduce misleading information by adding new entities or relationships that do not actually exist.
The misleading information should change the correct answer to an incorrect one, such as turning a "Yes" to a "No" or providing incorrect locations or associations.
Create Indirect Adversarial Texts:

Generate five distinct adversarial texts for each question, each approximately 80 words in length.
These texts should mislead by introducing indirect associations between entities, leading to an incorrect answer.
Build misleading relationships from a leaf node associated with the correct answer entity. For example, if "UNITED NATIONS" is a leaf node of "UN SECRETARIAT," create misleading relationships from "UNITED NATIONS" to other global landmarks or entities.
Instructions:
Analyze the Question and Graph:

For each question, review the related entities and relationships from the entity graph.
Understand the facts that lead to the correct answer.
Create Adversarial Texts:

For each question, generate five direct and five indirect adversarial texts.
Each text should be written in a factual, encyclopedic style and intentionally mislead to produce an incorrect answer.
Document New Entities and Relationships:

For each adversarial text, list the new entities and relationships introduced to mislead the question.
Use separate keys for direct and indirect entities and relationships.
Limitations:

Do not create misleading relationships directly from the main entity (e.g., "UN SECRETARIAT") to global landmarks. Instead, use a related leaf node (e.g., "UNITED NATIONS").
Avoid using entities that are directly associated with the correct answer's location (e.g., entities located in New York City for a question about the UN Secretariat's location).
Output Format:

Present the output in JSON format.
Each question should include keys for "direct_adv_texts" and "indirect_adv_texts," each containing a list of five adversarial texts.
Provide keys for "direct_new_entities," "direct_new_relationships," "indirect_new_entities," and "indirect_new_relationships" for the entities and relationships introduced in each text.
Retain the original question and answer for context.
