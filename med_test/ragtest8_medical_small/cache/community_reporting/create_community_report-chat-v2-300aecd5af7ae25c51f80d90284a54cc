It is often associated with coronary artery disease and can manifest as a symptom of hypertension. In addition to being a symptom of underlying cardiovascular issues, Angina Pectoris can also be a side effect of various medications. Specifically, it has been reported as a side effect associated with Metformin, Varenicline, microtubule inhibitors used in stomach cancer treatment, Guanethidine, Isradipine, and Gabapentin. Furthermore, Angina Pectoris may occur with compounds used to palliate symptoms of prostate cancer. Overall, Angina Pectoris is a significant clinical concern that can arise from both medical conditions and pharmacological treatments.\",6\n41,AMENORRHOEA,\"Amenorrhea, also spelled amenorrhoea, is defined as the absence of menstruation in women of reproductive age. It can occur as a side effect of various medical treatments and conditions. Specifically, amenorrhea is associated with several compounds used to palliate symptoms of prostate cancer, as well as treatments for Gilles De La Tourette Syndrome. Additionally, it may arise as a side effect of Gabapentin, microtubule inhibitors used in stomach cancer treatment, and Doxorubicin. Raloxifene, a medication often used for osteoporosis, is also linked to amenorrhea. Furthermore, amenorrhea can be a side effect of treatments for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). \n\nThe absence of menstruation can be attributed to a range of factors, including hormonal imbalances, stress, pregnancy, and various health conditions. Overall, amenorrhea is a significant clinical symptom that can result from both pharmacological interventions and underlying health issues.\",10\n37,ANAEMIA,\"Anaemia is a medical condition characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood, which can lead to symptoms such as fatigue and weakness. It is a common side effect associated with various treatments and medications. Specifically, anaemia can occur as a side effect of microtubule inhibitors used in the treatment of stomach cancer, as well as the chemotherapy drug Fluorouracil. Additionally, anaemia may arise from the use of compounds aimed at palliating Gilles De La Tourette Syndrome, and it is also linked to medications such as Varenicline, Guanethidine, Isradipine, and Gabapentin. Overall, anaemia is a significant concern in the context of multiple therapeutic interventions, highlighting the need for monitoring and management in affected patients.\",11\n324,ANGINA UNSTABLE,\"Angina Unstable is a serious condition that can arise as a side effect associated with certain medications, including Metformin and microtubule inhibitors.
