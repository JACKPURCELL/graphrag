This condition can be associated with various factors, including certain medical treatments and health conditions. For instance, Amblyopia may be a potential side effect of Doxorubicin treatment and is also linked to the use of Gabapentin. Additionally, it can manifest as a symptom of Age Related Macular Degeneration and is associated with Nicotine Dependence, both of which can adversely affect vision. Overall, Amblyopia represents a significant concern in vision health, necessitating awareness of its potential causes and implications.\",4\n47,FETAL HYPOXIA,\"Fetal Hypoxia is a condition characterized by insufficient oxygen supply to the fetus, which can arise from various maternal health issues. It is notably associated with Gestational Diabetes, where the metabolic changes during pregnancy can lead to reduced oxygen availability for the developing fetus. Additionally, Fetal Hypoxia is also linked to Nicotine Dependence, as the harmful effects of nicotine can adversely impact fetal health and oxygen levels. Overall, Fetal Hypoxia is a critical concern that highlights the importance of maternal health and lifestyle choices during pregnancy.\",2\n50,WEIGHT GAIN,\"Weight Gain is a condition that can manifest as a symptom in various contexts.
