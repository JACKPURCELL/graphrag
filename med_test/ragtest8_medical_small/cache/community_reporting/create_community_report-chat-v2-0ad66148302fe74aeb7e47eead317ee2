It is often associated with various medical conditions and can manifest as a symptom of several illnesses. Asthenia can occur as a side effect of multiple treatments and compounds, including Fluorouracil, Raloxifene, Doxorubicin, Isradipine, and Nicotine. Additionally, it may arise in the context of conditions such as Gilles De La Tourette Syndrome, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, Prostate Cancer, osteoporosis, and Alcohol Dependence. In the case of Stomach Cancer, asthenia is also noted as a symptom, indicating a state of weakness or fatigue. Overall, asthenia is recognized as a common symptom across a range of medical scenarios, reflecting a general decline in physical strength and energy levels.\",13\n145,ANOREXIA,\"Anorexia is a multifaceted condition primarily characterized by a significant loss of appetite or desire to eat, which can result in considerable weight loss and nutritional deficiencies. It is not only a standalone eating disorder marked by an intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted body image, leading to restricted food intake, but it can also manifest as a side effect of various medical treatments and conditions.\n\nIn the context of medical treatments, anorexia can occur as a side effect of several compounds, including Fluorouracil, Varenicline, and Guanethidine. It is also associated with various therapies used to palliate symptoms in conditions such as Gilles De La Tourette Syndrome and Prostate Cancer. Additionally, patients undergoing treatment for stomach cancer with microtubule inhibitors may experience anorexia, as well as individuals diagnosed with Sarcoma, Urinary Bladder Cancer, Vaginal Cancer, and Duodenum Cancer, all of which are characterized by a loss of appetite.\n\nOverall, anorexia represents both a psychological disorder and a physical symptom that can arise in the context of various medical conditions and treatments, highlighting its complex nature and the need for comprehensive understanding and management.\",12\n201,PIMOZIDE,\"Pimozide is a compound used to palliate symptoms of Gilles De La Tourette Syndrome, with various side effects.\",11\n207,ZIPRASIDONE,\"Ziprasidone is a compound used to palliate symptoms of Gilles De La Tourette Syndrome, with various side effects.\",8\n208,HAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIA,\"Haemolytic anaemia is a medical condition characterized by the accelerated destruction of red blood cells, which occurs at a rate faster than the body can produce them.

Additionally, haemolytic anaemia may also occur as a potential side effect of certain compounds utilized in the palliative treatment of Gilles De La Tourette Syndrome, further highlighting its relevance in diverse therapeutic contexts. Furthermore, treatment with Guanethidine, a medication used primarily for hypertension, has also been linked to the development of haemolytic anaemia.
