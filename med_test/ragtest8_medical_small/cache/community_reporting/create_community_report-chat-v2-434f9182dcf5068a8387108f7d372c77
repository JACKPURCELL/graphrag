It is often associated with various health issues, including hypertension, where it manifests as a symptom of fluid accumulation. Additionally, edema can be indicative of several specific medical conditions, such as Prostate Cancer, Fuchs' Endothelial Dystrophy, Membranous Glomerulonephritis, Penile Cancer, and Stomach Cancer, all of which involve swelling due to fluid retention. \n\nMoreover, edema may also present in patients with leprosy, osteoporosis, and Age Related Macular Degeneration, the latter specifically involving fluid accumulation in the eye. Furthermore, it can occur in individuals diagnosed with Urinary Bladder Cancer, again highlighting the role of fluid retention in the symptomatology of these various conditions. Overall, edema serves as a significant clinical indicator across a range of diseases, reflecting the underlying issue of fluid imbalance in the body.\",9\n110,PAIN,\"PAIN is a significant symptom associated with various medical conditions, indicating discomfort or distress in the body. In the context of Ureter Cancer, pain serves as a common symptom experienced by patients. Similarly, individuals suffering from osteoporosis often report pain, which typically arises from fractures or the weakening of bones. Additionally, pain is a prevalent symptom in patients diagnosed with Prostate Cancer, as well as in those with Penile Cancer, where it signifies discomfort or suffering. Overall, pain is a critical indicator of underlying health issues across these different conditions.\",4\n115,PENIS,\"The penis is a male reproductive organ that serves multiple functions in the male anatomy. It is primarily recognized as a localization site for penile cancer, which specifically affects the tissues of the penis. Additionally, the penis can also be a site for prostate cancer, although this type of cancer primarily originates in the prostate gland, which is located near the penis. Furthermore, the penis is associated with urinary bladder cancer, indicating its relevance in the context of urinary system malignancies.
