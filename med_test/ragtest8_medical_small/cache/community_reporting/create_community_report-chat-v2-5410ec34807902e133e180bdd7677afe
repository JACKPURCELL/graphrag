It is a potential side effect of several medications and compounds. Specifically, arrhythmia can occur as a side effect of Doxorubicin, which affects heart rhythm, and is also associated with various treatments for Gilles De La Tourette Syndrome, characterized by irregular heartbeats. Additionally, arrhythmia may arise from the use of microtubule inhibitors in the treatment of stomach cancer, as well as from the compound Nicotine. Furthermore, Fluorouracil is another medication linked to the occurrence of arrhythmia. Overall, arrhythmia is a significant concern in the context of these treatments and substances, necessitating careful monitoring and management.\",5\n130,ABSCESS,\"An abscess is a medical condition characterized by a collection of pus in a tissue, and it can arise as a potential side effect associated with various treatments. Specifically, abscesses may occur as a side effect of compounds used to palliate symptoms of Gilles De La Tourette Syndrome and Prostate Cancer. Additionally, the use of Doxorubicin, a chemotherapy medication, can also lead to the development of abscesses in different parts of the body.
