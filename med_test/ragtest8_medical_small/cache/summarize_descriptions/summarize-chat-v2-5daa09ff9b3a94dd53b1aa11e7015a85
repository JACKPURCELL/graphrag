{"result": "Vomiting is a symptom that can be associated with various types of cancer, including Appendix Cancer and Duodenum Cancer. In the context of Appendix Cancer, vomiting may occur as a result of the disease's impact on the digestive system. Similarly, in cases of Duodenum Cancer, vomiting involves the expulsion of stomach contents through the mouth, indicating a disruption in normal digestive processes.
