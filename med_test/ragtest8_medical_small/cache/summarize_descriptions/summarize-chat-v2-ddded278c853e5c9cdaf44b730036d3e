{"result": "Albuminuria is a medical condition characterized by the presence of albumin in the urine, which often indicates kidney damage or disease. It can manifest as a side effect of certain treatments, such as Doxorubicin, and may also occur with various compounds used to palliate symptoms of prostate cancer. Additionally, albuminuria can be a symptom of hypertension, where an excess of albumin in the urine further signals potential kidney issues.
