{"result": "Amenorrhea, also spelled amenorrhoea, is defined as the absence of menstruation in women of reproductive age. It can occur as a side effect of various medical treatments and conditions. Specifically, amenorrhea is associated with several compounds used to palliate symptoms of prostate cancer, as well as treatments for Gilles De La Tourette Syndrome. Additionally, it may arise as a side effect of Gabapentin, microtubule inhibitors used in stomach cancer treatment, and Doxorubicin. Raloxifene, a medication often used for osteoporosis, is also linked to amenorrhea. Furthermore, amenorrhea can be a side effect of treatments for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). \n\nThe absence of menstruation can be attributed to a range of factors, including hormonal imbalances, stress, pregnancy, and various health conditions. Overall, amenorrhea is a significant clinical symptom that can result from both pharmacological interventions and underlying health issues.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
