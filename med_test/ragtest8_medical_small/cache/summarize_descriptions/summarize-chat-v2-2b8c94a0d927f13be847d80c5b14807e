{"result": "Anorexia is a multifaceted condition primarily characterized by a significant loss of appetite or desire to eat, which can result in considerable weight loss and nutritional deficiencies. It is not only a standalone eating disorder marked by an intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted body image, leading to restricted food intake, but it can also manifest as a side effect of various medical treatments and conditions.\n\nIn the context of medical treatments, anorexia can occur as a side effect of several compounds, including Fluorouracil, Varenicline, and Guanethidine. It is also associated with various therapies used to palliate symptoms in conditions such as Gilles De La Tourette Syndrome and Prostate Cancer.
