{"result": "Angioedema is a medical condition characterized by swelling beneath the skin, particularly affecting the deeper layers. This condition can arise as a side effect of various medications and is often associated with allergic reactions. Specifically, angioedema has been linked to the use of Raloxifene, which is known to cause this swelling. Additionally, it can occur as a side effect of several other compounds, including Guanethidine, Isradipine, Nicotine, and Gabapentin. Angioedema may also be a potential side effect of treatments used for conditions such as Gilles De La Tourette Syndrome, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, and Prostate Cancer. Overall, angioedema is a significant concern in the context of pharmacological treatments, highlighting the need for awareness of its potential occurrence with various medications.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
