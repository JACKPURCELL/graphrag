{"result": "Angina Pectoris is a medical condition characterized by chest pain or discomfort resulting from reduced blood flow to the heart. It is often associated with coronary artery disease and can manifest as a symptom of hypertension. In addition to being a symptom of underlying cardiovascular issues, Angina Pectoris can also be a side effect of various medications. Specifically, it has been reported as a side effect associated with Metformin, Varenicline, microtubule inhibitors used in stomach cancer treatment, Guanethidine, Isradipine, and Gabapentin. Furthermore, Angina Pectoris may occur with compounds used to palliate symptoms of prostate cancer. Overall, Angina Pectoris is a significant clinical concern that can arise from both medical conditions and pharmacological treatments.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
