It is best known for its consumer electronics, software, and services. Apple's product lineup includes include the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Vision Pro, and Apple TV; as well as software like iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS; and services like Apple Card, Apple Pay, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.\n\nSince 2011, Apple has been the world's largest company by market capitalization except when Microsoft held the position between January and June 2024.[6][7][8] In 2022, Apple was the largest technology company by revenue, with US$394.3 billion.[9][failed verification] As of 2023, Apple was the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales,[10] the largest manufacturing company by revenue, and the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world.[11] It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon, Meta (the parent company of Facebook), and Microsoft.\n\nApple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, to produce and market Steve Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. The company was incorporated by Wozniak and Steve Jobs in 1977. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, the company's internal problems included the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives. That year Jobs left Apple to form NeXT, Inc., and Wozniak withdrew to other ventures. The market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, and Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced Wintel duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones.\n\nIn 1997, Apple was weeks away from bankruptcy. To resolve its failed operating system strategy and entice Jobs's return, it bought NeXT. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through several tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the \"Think different\" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden its product portfolio. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later. He was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.\n\nApple has received criticism regarding its contractors' labor practices, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, it has a large following and a high level of brand loyalty. It has been consistently ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.\n\nApple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, $2 trillion in August 2020, and at $3 trillion in January 2022. As of June 2024, it was valued at just over $3.2 trillion.[8]\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>APPLE INC.<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apple Inc. is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Cupertino, California, known for its consumer electronics, software, and services, including products like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and services like Apple Pay and iCloud.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUPERTINO<|>GEO<|>Cupertino is a city in California, known as the headquarters of Apple Inc.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALIFORNIA<|>GEO<|>California is a U.S. state where Apple Inc. is headquartered, located in Silicon Valley.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SILICON VALLEY<|>GEO<|>Silicon Valley is a region in California known for its technology companies, including Apple Inc.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEVE WOZNIAK<|>PERSON<|>Steve Wozniak is a co-founder of Apple Inc. and the designer of the Apple I personal computer.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEVE JOBS<|>PERSON<|>Steve Jobs was a co-founder of Apple Inc. and served as its CEO, known for guiding the company back to profitability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIM COOK<|>PERSON<|>Tim Cook is the current CEO of Apple Inc., succeeding Steve Jobs in 2011.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEXT, INC.<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NeXT, Inc. was a company founded by Steve Jobs after leaving Apple, which Apple acquired in 1997.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IMAC<|>EVENT<|>The iMac is a line of all-in-one computers designed by Apple Inc., introduced in 1998 as part of its recovery strategy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IPOD<|>EVENT<|>The iPod is a portable media player developed by Apple Inc., launched in 2001, which contributed to the company's resurgence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IPHONE<|>EVENT<|>The iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc., first released in 2007, revolutionizing the mobile phone industry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IPAD<|>EVENT<|>The iPad is a line of tablet computers designed by Apple Inc., first released in 2010, expanding the company's product portfolio.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEVE WOZNIAK<|>APPLE INC.<|>Steve Wozniak co-founded Apple Inc. and designed its first product, the Apple I<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEVE JOBS<|>APPLE INC.<|>Steve Jobs co-founded Apple Inc. and played a crucial role in its development and marketing strategies<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TIM COOK<|>APPLE INC.<|>Tim Cook succeeded Steve Jobs as CEO of Apple Inc. and continues to lead the company<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEXT, INC.<|>APPLE INC.<|>Apple Inc. acquired NeXT, Inc. to resolve its operating system issues and bring back Steve Jobs<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE INC.<|>IMAC<|>The iMac was introduced by Apple Inc. as part of its strategy to regain market share and profitability<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE INC.<|>IPOD<|>The iPod was launched by Apple Inc. as a key product that contributed to its resurgence in the early 2000s<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE INC.<|>IPHONE<|>The iPhone was developed and marketed by Apple Inc., significantly impacting the smartphone market<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE INC.<|>IPAD<|>The iPad was introduced by Apple Inc. as a new product category, enhancing its portfolio<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CUPERTINO<|>APPLE INC.<|>Apple Inc. is headquartered in Cupertino, California, making the city significant to its operations<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CALIFORNIA<|>APPLE INC.<|>California is the state where Apple Inc. is based, influencing its business environment<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SILICON VALLEY<|>APPLE INC.<|>Silicon Valley is the tech hub where Apple Inc. operates, contributing to its innovation and growth<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
