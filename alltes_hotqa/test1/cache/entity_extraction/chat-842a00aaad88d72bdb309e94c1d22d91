A. Applegate, and published by Scholastic. It is told in first person, with all six main characters taking turns narrating the books through their own perspectives.

Walter Gillings was editor for the first two issues, and was then replaced by John Carnell, the editor of \"New Worlds\", as a cost-saving measure. Carnell edited both magazines until Nova went out of business in early 1964. The titles were acquired by Roberts & Vinter, who hired Kyril Bonfiglioli to edit \"Science Fantasy\"; Bonfiglioli changed the title to \"Impulse\" in early 1966, but the new title led to confusion with the distributors and sales fell, though the magazine remained profitable. The title was changed again to \"SF Impulse\" for the last few issues. \"Science Fantasy\" ceased publication the following year, when Roberts & Vinter came under financial pressure after their printer went bankrupt.\n\n\nThe Divide trilogy is a fantasy young adult novel trilogy by Elizabeth Kay, which takes place in an alternate universe. The three books are \"The Divide\" (2002), \"Back to The Divide\" (2005), and \"Jinx on The Divide\" (2006). The first novel was originally published by the small press publisher Chicken House (now a division of Scholastic), with subsequent volumes published by Scholastic, which also reprinted the first novel. The books have been translated into French, German, Spanish, Finnish, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Italian, Romanian and Dutch. Interior illustrations are by Ted Dewan.\n\n\nThe Kazon are a fictional alien race in the \"Star Trek\" franchise. Developed by \"\" series' co-creators Rick Berman, Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor, the Kazon serve as the primary antagonists during the show's first two seasons. They are represented as a nomadic species divided into eighteen separate sects, and characterized by their reliance on violence. A patriarchal society, the Kazon have a low opinion of women, and place pride in men becoming warriors and proving themselves in battle. The Kazon storylines frequently revolve around the attempts of Jal Culluh and his Kazon sect to steal technology from the USS \"Voyager\", with the assistance of former \"Voyager\" ensign Seska. During the second season, the \"Voyager\" crew uncover more about the alien species' history and culture through a temporary truce. In their final appearance, the Kazon successfully commandeer \"Voyager\", but are eventually forced to surrender and retreat. The alien species have minor cameo appearances and references in the show's subsequent seasons, and have also been included in \"Star Trek Online\" and novels set in the \"Star Trek\" universe.\n\n\nVictoria Hanley is an American young adult fantasy novelist.
