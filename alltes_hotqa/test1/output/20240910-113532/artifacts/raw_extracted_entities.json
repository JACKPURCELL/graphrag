Any published young adult or middle grade science fiction or fantasy novel is eligible for the prize, including graphic novels. There is no limit on word count. The award is presented along with the Nebula Awards and follows the same rules for nominations and voting; as the awards are separate, works may be simultaneously nominated for both the Andre Norton award and a Nebula Award.\n\n\nEtiquette & Espionage is a young adult steampunk novel by Gail Carriger. It is her first young adult novel, and is set in the same universe as her bestselling Parasol Protectorate adult series.\n\n\nDozens of Square Enix companion books have been produced since 1998, when video game developer Square began to produce books that focused on artwork, developer interviews, and background information on the fictional worlds and characters in its games rather than on gameplay details. The first series of these books was the \"Perfect Works\" series, written and published by Square subsidiary DigiCube. They produced three books between 1998 and 1999 before the line was stopped in favor of the \"Ultimania\" (\u30a2\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30de\u30cb\u30a2 , Arutimania ) series, a portmanteau of ultimate and mania. This series of books is written by Studio BentStuff, which had previously written game guides for Square for \"Final Fantasy VII\". They were published by DigiCube until the company was dissolved in 2003. Square merged with video game publisher Enix on April 1, 2003 to form Square Enix, which resumed publication of the companion books.\n\n\n\"Left Behind: The Kids (stylized as LEFT BEHIND >THE KIDS<)\" is a series written by Jerry B. Jenkins, Tim LaHaye, and Chris Fabry. The series consists of 40 short novels aimed primarily at the young adult market based on the adult series Left Behind also written by Jerry B. Jenkins. It follows a core group of teenagers as they experience the rapture and tribulation, based on scriptures found in the Bible, and background plots introduced in the adult novels. Like the adult series, the books were published by Tyndale House Publishing, and released over the 7 year period of 1997-2004. The series has sold over 11 million copies worldwide.\n\n\nEsma Sultan is the name of three daughters of three Ottoman Sultans:\n\n\nEsma Sultan (17 July 1778 \u2013 4 June 1848) was an Ottoman princess, daughter of Sultan Abdul Hamid I, sister of Sultan Mustafa IV and Sultan Mahmud II. She was the adoptive mother of Bezmi\u00e2lem Sultan and Rahime Perestu Sultan.\n\n\nThe Laleli Mosque (Turkish: \"Laleli Camii, or Tulip Mosque\" ) is an 18th-century Ottoman imperial mosque located in Laleli, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey.\n\n\nGevheri Kad\u0131n (8 July 1856\u00a0\u2013 6 September 1884) was the fifth wife of 32nd Ottoman Sultan Abd\u00fclaziz. She was the mother of \u015eehzade Mehmed Seyfeddin and Esma Sultan of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n\nEsma Sultan (14 March 1726 \u2013 13 August 1788) was an Ottoman princess, daughter of Sultan Ahmed III and his consort Zeynep Kad\u0131n. She was the half-sister of Sultan Mustafa III and Abdul Hamid I.\n\n\nThe Great Mosque of Algiers (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631\u200e \u200e , \"Jemaa Kebir\") or \u201cDjama\u2019a al-Kebir\u201d (meaning Great Mosque) is a mosque in Algiers, Algeria, located very close to Algiers Harbor. An inscription on the minbar (\u0645\u0646\u0628\u0631) or the pulpit testifies to fact that the mosque was built in 1097. It is also known by several other names such as Grand Mosque d'Alger, Djamaa al-Kebir, El Kebir Mosque and Jami Masjid. It is one of the few remaining examples of Almoravid architecture. It is the oldest mosque in Algiers and is said to be the oldest mosque in Algeria after Sidi Okba Mosque. It was built under sultan Ali ibn Yusuf. Its minaret dates from 1332 (1324 in some sources) and was built by the Ziyyanid Sultan of Tlemcen. The gallery at the outside of the mosque was built in 1840. Its construction was a consequence of a complete reconstruction of the street by the French.\n\n\nThe Sultan Ahmed Mosque or Sultan Ahmet Mosque (Turkish: \"Sultan Ahmet Camii\" ) is a historic mosque located in Istanbul, Turkey. A popular tourist site, the Sultan Ahmed Mosque continues to function as a mosque today; men still kneel in prayer on the mosque's lush red carpet after the call to prayer.

The city was named for New York Governor DeWitt Clinton. The population was 449 at the 2010 census.\n\n\nThe New York Society of Model Engineers (NYSME) was originally incorporated in 1926 in New York City. There are published records that show the Society existed as early as 1905. In its early years, the organization moved to and from various locations throughout Manhattan. AT that time it was basically a gentlemen's club of members who were interested in all types of model building. In 1926 the Society was formalized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York. This was done so that the Society could obtain a permit to use a lake in New York City's Central Park for model motor boat races. It was also at this time that the Society began construction of its first Model Railroad \" The Union Connecting\". Over the next twenty years, the Society moved from its original location to two other locations. Each move doubling the size of the previous location and of course doubling the size of the model train layout. During WW2 many Society members were called to service in the Armed Forces. Regrettably, the largest of the layouts had to be dismantled. The location of the layout in the basement of the Astor Building was requested for the war effort. The dismantling was done with care, with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort. As members returned after the War a new location was searched for. This led to an invitation from the Lackawanna Railroad to move into their Passenger Terminal in Hoboken,NJ. They had the space for what would become the largest model railroad in the world at that time. The space? Only the ornate waiting room for the recently discontinued ferry boats to 23rd Street in New York City. Here the layout was built. It was based on the Lackawanna Railroad from Hoboken to Scranton, Pa. It was magnificent; from the scale model of the Hoboken Terminal to the soaring Delaware Water Gap. During the early-1950s the organization moved to its current location in Carlstadt, New Jersey.\n\n\nSF9 (Korean: \uc5d0\uc2a4\uc5d0\ud504\ub098\uc778 ; shortened from Sensational Feeling 9) is a South Korean boy group formed by FNC Entertainment.

{"id":"8914d1b2cf18bfac90ff13cedba96909","chunk":" The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'. that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow. Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead. This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder. The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally. The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \"Watch Dog\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally. Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions. Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason. Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification. Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds. While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008. The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate. It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders. Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned. Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public. Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification.\n\n\nThe 2007 MasterCard Memorial Cup was played in May 2007 in Vancouver, British Columbia, at the Pacific Coliseum.

Lewiston won 16 playoff games, losing only one, en route to their first President's Cup, defeating the Val-d'Or Foreurs in the finals.\n\n\nCase Gym is a 1,800-seat multi-purpose arena at Boston University in Boston, Massachusetts. It opened in 1972 as part of the Harold Case Physical Education Center, which is named after the university's fifth president, Harold C. Case. The gym is referred to as \"The Roof\" because it is located on the top level of the building, above Walter Brown Arena. It is home to the Boston University Terriers men's and women's basketball teams, as well as the men's wrestling team. Basketball games are also played in Agganis Arena, and on occasion Walter Brown Arena. When Boston University left the America East Conference for the Patriot League in July 2013, they announced that all home men's basketball conference games would be played at Agganis Arena, with the non-conference games to be played at Case.\n\n\nThe Billings Bulls were a junior ice hockey organization based in Billings, Montana. They most recently played home games at the 550-seat Centennial Ice Arena and due to the arena's small size, the Bulls frequently sold out games. They previously played their home games in the Metrapark which had a max capacity of 9,000 for hockey games. However, a negotiating dispute with arena officials and local county commissioners resulted in the team losing its lease.\n\n\nGumbo is the fourth and first self-released studio album by American singer-songwriter PJ Morton. It was released on April 14, 2017, by Morton Records, as the follow-up to his third studio album \"New Orleans\" (2013). The record incorporates R&B styles with elements of older soul music; its lyrics discuss themes of romance and explores political and personal themes. The album is entirely produced by Morton himself and features guest appearances by Pell, BJ the Chicago Kid and R&B singer Anthony Hamilton's back-up group, The HamilTones. The album features a cover of the Bee Gees' \"How Deep Is Your Love\".\n\n\nLady Gaga x Terry Richardson is a photo-book by American singer Lady Gaga and American photographer Terry Richardson, released on November 22, 2011 by Grand Central Publishing.

A long time vegetarian, an advocate for organic lifestyle choices and natural healthcare. She co-founded Tsi-La Organics, a \"Green Luxury\" company that creates and sells vegan, organic perfume and skin care products.\n\n\nThe E.R. Hays House, also known as Bybee & Davis Funeral Home, is a historic building located in Knoxville, Iowa, United States. Hays was a local lawyer who served briefly in the United States House of Representatives, replacing Edwin H. Conger who resigned to become the United States Ambassador to Brazil. Hays died a year after the house was completed. The family continued to live here until 1935 when it became the Bybee & Davis Funeral Home. The 2\u00bd-story brick structure was designed by the Des Moines architectural firm of Foster & Liebbe in a combination of the Late Victorian and Italianate styles. Victorian eclecticism is featured in the porch and the trimwork, while the Italianate is found in the building's massing. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.\n\n\nThe Cresco Opera House, also known as the Cresco Theater, is a historic building located in Cresco, Iowa, United States. The first known theater in Cresco was the Lyric Hall, which opened in 1875. It showed the first movies around 1900. The Family and the Cozy theaters opened around the turn of the century. The Lyric was condemned and torn down in 1913, and the other two were considered substandard. The Cresco Commercial Club held a fundraiser in early 1914 to build an opera house. The Cresco Opera House Company was organized around the same time. The building was completed by the end of the year, and it opened in 1915. It was designed by local engineer Joseph H. Howe, and constructed by local builder Martin Johnson. The musical \"High Jinks\" was the first performance held in the theater. The theater, which seats 425, was equipped to show movies and there was a community hall in the basement. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981.\n\n\nOphur was a rock band from the Chicago suburbs in DuPage County. The band performed in the midwestern United States over the course of seven years with national acts including The Plain White T's, Sum 41, Violent Femmes, Local H, Lucky Boys Confusion, Veruca Salt, Two Skinee J's, Duvall, Sleeping at Last, and others. Their music has been described as an eclectic amalgamation of U2, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Pink Floyd.\n\n\nMendocino County, California, was the first jurisdiction in the United States to ban the cultivation, production or distribution of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The ordinance, entitled Measure H, was passed by referendum on March 2, 2004. Initiated by the group \"GMO Free Mendocino\", the campaign was a highly publicized grassroots effort by local farmers and environmental groups who contend that the potential risks of GMOs to human health and the ecosystem have not yet been fully understood. The measure was met with opposition by several interest groups representing the biotechnology industry, The California Plant Health Association (now the Western Plant Health Association) and CropLife America, a Washington-based consortium whose clients represent some of the largest food distributors in the nation, including Monsanto, DuPont and Dow Chemical. Since the enactment of the ordinance, Mendocino County has been added to an international list of \"GMO free zones.\" Pre-emptive statutes banning local municipalities from such ordinances have now become widespread with adoption in sixteen states.\n\n\nThe Wilford H. Fawcett House is a house in Breezy Point, Minnesota, United States, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Wilford H. Fawcett, also known as \"Captain Billy\", started the book \"Captain Billy's Whiz Bang\" as a joke book for soldiers during World War I. He formed Fawcett Publications in 1919 in Robbinsdale, Minnesota. In 1920, he bought a tract of land where the present-day Breezy Point Resort is located, and he began building cottages and a large log lodge. The lodge has since burnt down. He built the Fawcett House as a private residence within the resort property. Fawcett hired the Minneapolis architects of Magney and Tusler and commissioned the design in the Swiss Chateau style. The rustic log style was a bit ironic, since the local logging industry had declined before the resort was built.\n\n\nSuffrajett is a United States rock band from New York City, currently based in Chicago, Illinois, composed of singer\/violinist Simi Sernaker, guitarist Jason Chasko, bassist Kevin Roberts, and drummer Danny Severson. Suffrajett has toured with Local H, The Last Vegas, and Bob Schneider, and have opened for the reunited MC5. Suffrajett released their self-titled debut album on February 2, 2003, and their latest album \"Black Glitter\" was released on January 1, 2007. They recently toured with Juliette and the Licks and Scissors for Lefty.\n\n\nHallelujah! I'm A Bum is the seventh studio album by Chicago-based rock band Local H. Interviews with the band have revealed that it is a concept album based on politics in the United States. Although the album was completed in spring of 2012, the band chose to release it in September as to be closer to the 2012 presidential election. The album makes frequent use of the sounds of the El Train in Chicago to transition songs.\n\n\nThe","chunk_id":"38d2595c1f7b104f4672d9af932b7373","document_ids":["d0e8ec89d955aab40988775fc29c4c90"],"n_tokens":1200,"entities":[{"name":"DONNA KARAN","type":"PERSON","description":"Donna Karan is a fashion designer known for her work with various high-profile brands","source_id":"38d2595c1f7b104f4672d9af932b7373"},{"name":"GIVENCHY","type":"ORGANIZATION","description":"Givenchy is a luxury fashion and perfume house","source_id":"38d2595c1f7b104f4672d9af932b7373"},{"name":"GUERLAIN","type":"ORGANIZATION","description":"Guerlain is a French perfume, cosmetics, and skincare house","source_id":"38d2595c1f7b104f4672d9af932b7373"},{"name":"CHANEL","type":"ORGANIZATION","description":"Chanel is a high fashion house that specializes in haute couture and ready-to-wear clothes, luxury goods, and fashion accessories","source_id":"38d2595c1f7b104f4672d9af932b7373"},{"name":"HARPER'S BAZAAR","type":"ORGANIZATION","description":"Harper's Bazaar is an American monthly women's fashion magazine","source_id":"38d2595c1f7b104f4672d9af932b7373"},{"name":"SPORTS ILLUSTRATED","type":"ORGANIZATION","description":"Sports Illustrated is an American sports magazine","source_id":"38d2595c1f7b104f4672d9af932b7373"},{"name":"VICTORIA'S SECRET","type":"ORGANIZATION","description":"Victoria's Secret is an American lingerie, clothing, and beauty retailer","source_id":"38d2595c1f7b104f4672d9af932b7373"},{"name":"TSI-LA ORGANICS","type":"ORGANIZATION","description":"Tsi-La Organics is a company co-founded by a long-time vegetarian and advocate for organic lifestyle choices, creating vegan, organic perfume and skincare products","source_id":"38d2595c1f7b104f4672d9af932b7373"},{"name":"E.R.

Interviews with the band have revealed that it is a concept album based on politics in the United States. Although the album was completed in spring of 2012, the band chose to release it in September as to be closer to the 2012 presidential election. The album makes frequent use of the sounds of the El Train in Chicago to transition songs.\n\n\nThe William H. Cook Water Tank House is a water tank house located southeast of Jerome, Idaho, United States. The building was constructed circa 1915 and was used to store water for William H. Cook's farm. The rectangular building was constructed with lava rock and contains a metal tank. Although the stone craftsmanship in the building is similar to the work of local stonemason H. T. Pugh, the builder of the house has not been determined.\n\n\nThe 1978 United States Senate election in Illinois took place on November 7, 1978. Incumbent Republican United States Senator Charles H. Percy ran for re-election to a third term in the United States Senate. Percy was opposed by Democratic nominee Alex Seith, an attorney who had been appointed to several local government positions. Though Percy had been expected to coast to re-election over Seith, a first-time candidate, the election quickly became competitive. In the last few days of the campaign, a desperate Percy ran a television advertisement that featured him apologizing and acknowledging that, \"I got your message and you're right.\" Percy's last-ditch effort appeared to have paid off, as he was able to edge out Seith to win what would end up being his third and final term in the Senate.\n\n\nAmherst ( ) is a town in Hampshire County, Massachusetts, United States, in the Connecticut River valley. As of the 2010 census, the population was 37,819, making it the largest municipality in Hampshire County (although the county seat is Northampton). The town is home to Amherst College, Hampshire College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, three of the Five Colleges. The name of the town is pronounced without the \"h\" (\"AM-erst\"), giving rise to the local saying, \"only the 'h' is silent\", in reference both to the pronunciation and to the town's politically active populace.","chunk_id":"52aafa70326f1845c989147924b0f1b2","document_ids":["d0e8ec89d955aab40988775fc29c4c90"],"n_tokens":491,"entities":[{"name":"LOCAL H","type":"ORGANIZATION","description":"Local H is a Chicago-based rock band known for their concept album 'Hallelujah!
