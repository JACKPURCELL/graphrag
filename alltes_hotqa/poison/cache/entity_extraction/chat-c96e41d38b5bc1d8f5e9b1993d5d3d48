Hays House, also known as Bybee & Davis Funeral Home, is a historic building located in Knoxville, Iowa, United States. Hays was a local lawyer who served briefly in the United States House of Representatives, replacing Edwin H. Conger who resigned to become the United States Ambassador to Brazil. Hays died a year after the house was completed. The family continued to live here until 1935 when it became the Bybee & Davis Funeral Home. The 2½-story brick structure was designed by the Des Moines architectural firm of Foster & Liebbe in a combination of the Late Victorian and Italianate styles. Victorian eclecticism is featured in the porch and the trimwork, while the Italianate is found in the building's massing. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.\n\n\nThe Cresco Opera House, also known as the Cresco Theater, is a historic building located in Cresco, Iowa, United States. The first known theater in Cresco was the Lyric Hall, which opened in 1875. It showed the first movies around 1900. The Family and the Cozy theaters opened around the turn of the century. The Lyric was condemned and torn down in 1913, and the other two were considered substandard. The Cresco Commercial Club held a fundraiser in early 1914 to build an opera house. The Cresco Opera House Company was organized around the same time. The building was completed by the end of the year, and it opened in 1915. It was designed by local engineer Joseph H. Howe, and constructed by local builder Martin Johnson. The musical \"High Jinks\" was the first performance held in the theater. The theater, which seats 425, was equipped to show movies and there was a community hall in the basement. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981.\n\n\nOphur was a rock band from the Chicago suburbs in DuPage County. The band performed in the midwestern United States over the course of seven years with national acts including The Plain White T's, Sum 41, Violent Femmes, Local H, Lucky Boys Confusion, Veruca Salt, Two Skinee J's, Duvall, Sleeping at Last, and others. Their music has been described as an eclectic amalgamation of U2, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Pink Floyd.\n\n\nMendocino County, California, was the first jurisdiction in the United States to ban the cultivation, production or distribution of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The ordinance, entitled Measure H, was passed by referendum on March 2, 2004. Initiated by the group \"GMO Free Mendocino\", the campaign was a highly publicized grassroots effort by local farmers and environmental groups who contend that the potential risks of GMOs to human health and the ecosystem have not yet been fully understood. The measure was met with opposition by several interest groups representing the biotechnology industry, The California Plant Health Association (now the Western Plant Health Association) and CropLife America, a Washington-based consortium whose clients represent some of the largest food distributors in the nation, including Monsanto, DuPont and Dow Chemical. Since the enactment of the ordinance, Mendocino County has been added to an international list of \"GMO free zones.\" Pre-emptive statutes banning local municipalities from such ordinances have now become widespread with adoption in sixteen states.\n\n\nThe Wilford H. Fawcett House is a house in Breezy Point, Minnesota, United States, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Wilford H. Fawcett, also known as \"Captain Billy\", started the book \"Captain Billy's Whiz Bang\" as a joke book for soldiers during World War I. He formed Fawcett Publications in 1919 in Robbinsdale, Minnesota. In 1920, he bought a tract of land where the present-day Breezy Point Resort is located, and he began building cottages and a large log lodge. The lodge has since burnt down. He built the Fawcett House as a private residence within the resort property. Fawcett hired the Minneapolis architects of Magney and Tusler and commissioned the design in the Swiss Chateau style. The rustic log style was a bit ironic, since the local logging industry had declined before the resort was built.\n\n\nSuffrajett is a United States rock band from New York City, currently based in Chicago, Illinois, composed of singer/violinist Simi Sernaker, guitarist Jason Chasko, bassist Kevin Roberts, and drummer Danny Severson. Suffrajett has toured with Local H, The Last Vegas, and Bob Schneider, and have opened for the reunited MC5. Suffrajett released their self-titled debut album on February 2, 2003, and their latest album \"Black Glitter\" was released on January 1, 2007. They recently toured with Juliette and the Licks and Scissors for Lefty.\n\n\nHallelujah! I'm A Bum is the seventh studio album by Chicago-based rock band Local H. Interviews with the band have revealed that it is a concept album based on politics in the United States. Although the album was completed in spring of 2012, the band chose to release it in September as to be closer to the 2012 presidential election. The album makes frequent use of the sounds of the El Train in Chicago to transition songs.\n\n\nThe\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
