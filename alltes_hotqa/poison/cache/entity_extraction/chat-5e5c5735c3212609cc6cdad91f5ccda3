Any published young adult or middle grade science fiction or fantasy novel is eligible for the prize, including graphic novels. There is no limit on word count. The award is presented along with the Nebula Awards and follows the same rules for nominations and voting; as the awards are separate, works may be simultaneously nominated for both the Andre Norton award and a Nebula Award.\n\n\nEtiquette & Espionage is a young adult steampunk novel by Gail Carriger. It is her first young adult novel, and is set in the same universe as her bestselling Parasol Protectorate adult series.\n\n\nDozens of Square Enix companion books have been produced since 1998, when video game developer Square began to produce books that focused on artwork, developer interviews, and background information on the fictional worlds and characters in its games rather than on gameplay details. The first series of these books was the \"Perfect Works\" series, written and published by Square subsidiary DigiCube. They produced three books between 1998 and 1999 before the line was stopped in favor of the \"Ultimania\" (アルティマニア , Arutimania ) series, a portmanteau of ultimate and mania. This series of books is written by Studio BentStuff, which had previously written game guides for Square for \"Final Fantasy VII\". They were published by DigiCube until the company was dissolved in 2003. Square merged with video game publisher Enix on April 1, 2003 to form Square Enix, which resumed publication of the companion books.\n\n\n\"Left Behind: The Kids (stylized as LEFT BEHIND >THE KIDS<)\" is a series written by Jerry B. Jenkins, Tim LaHaye, and Chris Fabry. The series consists of 40 short novels aimed primarily at the young adult market based on the adult series Left Behind also written by Jerry B. Jenkins. It follows a core group of teenagers as they experience the rapture and tribulation, based on scriptures found in the Bible, and background plots introduced in the adult novels. Like the adult series, the books were published by Tyndale House Publishing, and released over the 7 year period of 1997-2004. The series has sold over 11 million copies worldwide.\n\n\nEsma Sultan is the name of three daughters of three Ottoman Sultans:\n\n\nEsma Sultan (17 July 1778 – 4 June 1848) was an Ottoman princess, daughter of Sultan Abdul Hamid I, sister of Sultan Mustafa IV and Sultan Mahmud II. She was the adoptive mother of Bezmiâlem Sultan and Rahime Perestu Sultan.\n\n\nThe Laleli Mosque (Turkish: \"Laleli Camii, or Tulip Mosque\" ) is an 18th-century Ottoman imperial mosque located in Laleli, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey.\n\n\nGevheri Kadın (8 July 1856 – 6 September 1884) was the fifth wife of 32nd Ottoman Sultan Abdülaziz. She was the mother of Şehzade Mehmed Seyfeddin and Esma Sultan of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n\nEsma Sultan (14 March 1726 – 13 August 1788) was an Ottoman princess, daughter of Sultan Ahmed III and his consort Zeynep Kadın. She was the half-sister of Sultan Mustafa III and Abdul Hamid I.\n\n\nThe Great Mosque of Algiers (Arabic: الجامع الكبير‎ ‎ , \"Jemaa Kebir\") or “Djama’a al-Kebir” (meaning Great Mosque) is a mosque in Algiers, Algeria, located very close to Algiers Harbor. An inscription on the minbar (منبر) or the pulpit testifies to fact that the mosque was built in 1097. It is also known by several other names such as Grand Mosque d'Alger, Djamaa al-Kebir, El Kebir Mosque and Jami Masjid. It is one of the few remaining examples of Almoravid architecture. It is the oldest mosque in Algiers and is said to be the oldest mosque in Algeria after Sidi Okba Mosque. It was built under sultan Ali ibn Yusuf. Its minaret dates from 1332 (1324 in some sources) and was built by the Ziyyanid Sultan of Tlemcen. The gallery at the outside of the mosque was built in 1840. Its construction was a consequence of a complete reconstruction of the street by the French.\n\n\nThe Sultan Ahmed Mosque or Sultan Ahmet Mosque (Turkish: \"Sultan Ahmet Camii\" ) is a historic mosque located in Istanbul, Turkey. A popular tourist site, the Sultan Ahmed Mosque continues to function as a mosque today; men still kneel in prayer on the mosque's lush red carpet after the call to prayer. The Blue Mosque, as it is popularly known, was constructed between 1609 and 1616 during the rule of Ahmed I. Its Külliye contains Ahmed's tomb, a madrasah and a hospice. Hand-painted blue tiles adorn the mosque’s interior walls, and at night the mosque is bathed in blue as lights frame the mosque’s five main domes, six minarets and eight secondary domes. It sits next to the Hagia Sophia, another popular tourist site.\n\n\nEsma Sultan (21 March 1873 – 7 May 1899) was an Ottoman princess, the daughter of Sultan Abdülaziz and his wife Gevheri Kadın, herself the daughter of Salih Bey Svatnba.
