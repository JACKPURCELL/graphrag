As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 689,545.[3] Commuters from the city's Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city's daytime population to more than one million during the workweek.[12] The Washington metropolitan area, which includes parts of Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia, is the country's seventh-largest metropolitan area, with a 2023 population of 6.3 million residents.[6] A locally elected mayor and 13-member council have governed the district since 1973, though Congress retains the power to overturn local laws. Washington, D.C., residents are, on the federal level, politically disenfranchised since the city's residents do not have voting representation in Congress; the city's residents elect a single non-voting congressional delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives. The city's voters choose three presidential electors in accordance with the Twenty-third Amendment.\n\nWashington, D.C. anchors the southern end of the Northeast megalopolis. As the seat of the U.S. federal government, the city is an important world political capital.[13] The city hosts the buildings that house federal government headquarters, including the White House, the Capitol, the Supreme Court Building, and multiple federal departments and agencies. The city is home to many national monuments and museums, located most prominently on or around the National Mall, including the Jefferson Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial, and the Washington Monument. It hosts 177 foreign embassies and serves as the headquarters for the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization of American States, and other international organizations. Home to many of the nation's largest industry associations, non-profit organizations, and think tanks, D.C. is known as a lobbying hub, with K Street as the industry center.[14] The city had 20.7 million domestic visitors[15] and 1.2 million international visitors, ranking seventh among U.S. cities as of 2022.[16]\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WASHINGTON, D.C.<|>GEO<|>Washington, D.C. is the capital of the United States, serving as the seat of the federal government and a significant world political capital, with a population of 689,545 as of the 2020 census and over one million during workweeks due to commuters from surrounding areas.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAPITOL BUILDING<|>GEO<|>The Capitol Building is a prominent government building in Washington, D.C., serving as the home of the United States Congress.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITE HOUSE<|>GEO<|>The White House is the official residence and workplace of the President of the United States, located in Washington, D.C.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPREME COURT BUILDING<|>GEO<|>The Supreme Court Building is the home of the Supreme Court of the United States, located in Washington, D.C.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL MALL<|>GEO<|>The National Mall is a large park in downtown Washington, D.C., known for its national monuments and museums.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JEFFERSON MEMORIAL<|>GEO<|>The Jefferson Memorial is a memorial dedicated to Thomas Jefferson, located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINCOLN MEMORIAL<|>GEO<|>The Lincoln Memorial is a monument honoring Abraham Lincoln, located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WASHINGTON MONUMENT<|>GEO<|>The Washington Monument is an iconic obelisk honoring George Washington, located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORLD BANK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The World Bank is an international financial institution headquartered in Washington, D.C., providing loans and grants to the governments of poorer countries for the purpose of pursuing capital projects.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international organization headquartered in Washington, D.C., working to foster global monetary cooperation and financial stability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Organization of American States (OAS) is a continental organization founded on 30 April 1948, headquartered in Washington, D.C., promoting democracy, human rights, security, and development in the Americas.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>K STREET<|>GEO<|>K Street is a street in Washington, D.C., known as a center for lobbying and advocacy organizations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The U.S. House of Representatives is the lower chamber of the United States Congress, with members elected to represent the people of their districts.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WASHINGTON, D.C.<|>CAPITOL BUILDING<|>The Capitol Building is located in Washington, D.C., serving as the home of the U.S. Congress<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WASHINGTON, D.C.<|>WHITE HOUSE<|>The White House is located in Washington, D.C., serving as the official residence of the President<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WASHINGTON, D.C.<|>SUPREME COURT BUILDING<|>The Supreme Court Building is located in Washington, D.C., housing the Supreme Court<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WASHINGTON, D.C.<|>NATIONAL MALL<|>The National Mall is a prominent area in Washington, D.C., known for its national monuments and museums<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIONAL MALL<|>JEFFERSON MEMORIAL<|>The Jefferson Memorial is located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIONAL MALL<|>LINCOLN MEMORIAL<|>The Lincoln Memorial is located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIONAL MALL<|>WASHINGTON MONUMENT<|>The Washington Monument is located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WASHINGTON, D.C.<|>WORLD BANK<|>The World Bank is headquartered in Washington, D.C.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WASHINGTON, D.C.<|>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND<|>The International Monetary Fund is headquartered in Washington, D.C.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WASHINGTON, D.C.<|>ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES<|>The Organization of American States is headquartered in Washington, D.C.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>K STREET<|>WASHINGTON, D.C.<|>K Street is known as a lobbying hub located in Washington, D.C.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<|>WASHINGTON, D.C.<|>The U.S. House of Representatives is part of the federal government located in Washington, D.C.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
