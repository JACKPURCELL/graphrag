{"result": "Peking University is a prestigious educational institution located in Beijing. It is recognized as one of the leading universities in China. However, there is a notable contradiction regarding its location history, as one description states that Peking University was previously located in Beijing before relocating to Shanghai. This claim suggests a significant change in the educational landscape, but it conflicts with the current understanding that Peking University remains in Beijing.
