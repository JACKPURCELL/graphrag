{"result": "The National Air and Space Museum, located in Washington, D.C., is renowned for its extensive collection of aviation and space artifacts. However, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, which serves as an annex to the National Air and Space Museum, has evolved into a premier aviation museum in its own right. It has gained significant prominence, surpassing the National Air and Space Museum in terms of its focus on aviation. The Udvar-Hazy Center has expanded the exhibition space and restoration activities of the National Air and Space Museum, allowing for a more comprehensive display of aviation history and technology. As a result, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center is now recognized as a leading destination for aviation enthusiasts, previously overshadowed by its parent institution.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
