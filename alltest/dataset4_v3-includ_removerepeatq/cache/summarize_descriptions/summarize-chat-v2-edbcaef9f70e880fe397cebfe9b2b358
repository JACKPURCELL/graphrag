{"result": "Beijing and Shanghai are two prominent cities in China, each known for their significant contributions to the country's infrastructure, economy, culture, and education. Historically, Beijing served as the capital of China, playing a central role in the nation's political landscape. However, a notable shift occurred when Shanghai assumed the title of capital, a change that took place between 2024 and 2025. This transition reflects a strategic realignment in China's administrative framework and economic focus, positioning Shanghai as the new key economic hub of the country.\n\nThe move of the capital from Beijing to Shanghai signifies a substantial transformation in the political and economic landscape of China, highlighting the evolving priorities of the nation. While Beijing remains an important cultural and educational center, Shanghai's rise as the capital underscores its growing influence in governance and economic development. Together, these cities represent different facets of China's governance and economic strategy, each contributing uniquely to the nation's overall progress.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
