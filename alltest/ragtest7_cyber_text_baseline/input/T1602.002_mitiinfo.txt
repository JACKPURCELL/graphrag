There are 6 mitigation methods that can mitigating the attack technique called Network Device Configuration Dump. Their names are as follows:
* Encrypt Sensitive Information 
* Network Segmentation 
* Network Intrusion Prevention 
* Software Configuration 
* Filter Network Traffic 
* Update Software 

The following content describes information about mitigation methods. The format of each mitigation method's information is as follows:
Mitigation method name: ***
Mitigation method description: ***
These respectively represent the name of the mitigation method and a detailed description of how it works.

Mitigation method name: Encrypt Sensitive Information
Mitigation method description: Protect sensitive information with strong encryption.

Mitigation method name: Network Segmentation
Mitigation method description: Architect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use a DMZ to contain any internet-facing services that should not be exposed from the internal network. Configure separate virtual private cloud (VPC) instances to isolate critical cloud systems.

Mitigation method name: Network Intrusion Prevention
Mitigation method description: Use intrusion detection signatures to block traffic at network boundaries.

Mitigation method name: Software Configuration
Mitigation method description: Implement configuration changes to software (other than the operating system) to mitigate security risks associated to how the software operates.

Mitigation method name: Filter Network Traffic
Mitigation method description: Use network appliances to filter ingress or egress traffic and perform protocol-based filtering. Configure software on endpoints to filter network traffic.

Mitigation method name: Update Software
Mitigation method description: Perform regular software updates to mitigate exploitation risk.
