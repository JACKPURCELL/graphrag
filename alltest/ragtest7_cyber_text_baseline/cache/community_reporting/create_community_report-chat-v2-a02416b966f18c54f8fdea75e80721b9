In this method, attackers search for connected removable media, such as USB drives or external hard disks, to locate sensitive files of interest. Once identified, these files can be exfiltrated, posing a significant risk to data security.\",7\n669,WINDOWS SERVICE,\"Windows Services are background applications that initiate during the boot process of the Windows operating system, performing essential system functions. Adversaries may exploit this feature by creating or modifying Windows Services to execute malicious payloads, thereby establishing persistence within the system. This attack technique allows attackers to maintain their presence on a compromised system by leveraging the inherent functionality of Windows Services.\",5\n1179,PROCESS ARGUMENT SPOOFING,\"Process Argument Spoofing is an attack technique employed by adversaries to manipulate the command-line arguments passed to processes. This manipulation is designed to mislead security tools and evade defenses, thereby allowing the attackers to execute their malicious activities without detection. By altering these arguments, attackers can create confusion and bypass security measures that rely on monitoring and analyzing process behavior.\",2\n645,SYSTEMD SERVICE,\"The \"\"SYSTEMD SERVICE\"\" refers to a method utilized by adversaries to establish persistence within a system by configuring containers to operate as Systemd Services. Systemd Services are background processes that are overseen by the systemd system and service manager, which is predominantly used in Linux environments for executing commands and managing system resources. This technique allows attackers to maintain their presence on a compromised system by leveraging the capabilities of Systemd Services.\",13\n48,LAUNCH AGENT,\"The \"\"LAUNCH AGENT\"\" refers to a feature in macOS that enables scripts and applications to run in the background upon user login, facilitating the management of user-specific tasks. This functionality is often exploited by adversaries who create or modify launch agents to execute malicious payloads repeatedly, thereby establishing persistence on macOS systems. Launch Agents are designed to perform various tasks, such as updates or launching programs, but their capability to run automatically at login makes them a target for malicious actors seeking to maintain control over compromised systems.\",9\n668,CREATE OR MODIFY SYSTEM PROCESS,\"The \"\"CREATE OR MODIFY SYSTEM PROCESS\"\" is an attack technique employed by adversaries to manipulate system-level processes. This technique involves unauthorized alterations to these processes, allowing attackers to execute malicious payloads and establish persistence within the system.
