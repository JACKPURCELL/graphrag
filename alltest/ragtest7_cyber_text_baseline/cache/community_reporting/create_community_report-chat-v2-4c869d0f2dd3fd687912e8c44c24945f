This cross-platform functionality allows it to infect a wide range of devices, making it a significant threat in the cybersecurity landscape. The ability to control systems across different operating systems increases the potential for malicious activities, such as data theft and unauthorized surveillance. The software's distribution via a software-as-a-service platform further complicates detection and mitigation efforts, as it can be easily accessed and utilized by malicious actors.
