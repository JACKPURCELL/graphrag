This can involve the purchase, lease, rental, or acquisition of various types of infrastructure, including physical or cloud servers, domains, and third-party web services. By leveraging these resources, adversaries can enhance their operational capabilities and execute their malicious activities more effectively.\",9\n479,SERVER,\"The term \"\"SERVER\"\" refers to a system that provides data, resources, or services to other computers. In the context of adversary operations, servers are often utilized for hosting and orchestrating attacks. They can be either physical or virtual machines that adversaries use to stage and execute operations during cyber attacks.\",6\n1126,DNS SERVER,\"The DNS Server is a critical component of the internet infrastructure that translates domain names into IP addresses, enabling users to access websites and services using easily memorable names rather than numerical addresses. However, DNS Servers can also be exploited by adversaries for malicious purposes, including manipulation for cyber attacks and command and control during cyber operations. To mitigate the risks associated with DNS Server vulnerabilities, various pre-compromise activities and security measures can be implemented. Overall, while DNS Servers play an essential role in facilitating internet navigation, they also present potential security challenges that require careful management and protection.\",3\n696,SERVERLESS,\"Serverless refers to a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources, allowing users to run applications without the need to manage servers. This infrastructure presents unique challenges, as it can be exploited by adversaries, making it harder to trace their activities. Additionally, serverless is recognized as an attack technique that necessitates specific mitigation methods to prevent adversaries from gaining initial access. Overall, while serverless technology offers significant advantages in resource management and scalability, it also introduces vulnerabilities that require careful consideration and proactive security measures.\",3\n396,WEB SERVICES,\"Web Services are services offered over the internet that can be utilized by adversaries to stage and execute operations, effectively blending in with normal traffic.\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n618,PRE-COMPROMISE,ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE,Pre-compromise is a mitigation method specifically designed to counter the Acquire Infrastructure attack technique,41\n611,PRE-COMPROMISE,SERVER,Pre-compromise is a mitigation method specifically designed to counter the attack technique known as Server,38\n626,PRE-COMPROMISE,DNS SERVER,Pre-compromise is a mitigation method specifically designed to address the attack technique of DNS Server by preventing initial access,35\n620,PRE-COMPROMISE,SERVERLESS,Pre-compromise is a mitigation method specifically designed to counter the Serverless attack technique,35\n599,PRE-COMPROMISE,WEB SERVICES,Pre-compromise is a mitigation method specifically designed to address attack techniques related to Web Services,34\n1422,BOTNET,ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE,Botnets can be rented or purchased as part of the infrastructure adversaries acquire for launching attacks,15\n1495,SERVER,ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE,Servers are a key component of the infrastructure that adversaries may acquire for their operations,15\n1654,ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE,VIRTUAL PRIVATE SERVER,Virtual Private Servers are often acquired by adversaries to host their operations discreetly,14\n1381,DOMAINS,ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE,Domains can be part of the infrastructure acquired by adversaries to facilitate various attack techniques,13\n1653,ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE,DNS SERVER,DNS servers can be manipulated as part of the infrastructure used by adversaries to conduct attacks,12\n1655,ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE,SERVERLESS,Serverless computing can be utilized by adversaries as part of their infrastructure for executing operations,12\n1553,MALVERTISING,ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE,\"Malvertising may utilize acquired infrastructure to distribute malware effectively, leveraging online ads to reach victims\",12\n1423,BOTNET,SERVER,A botnet can utilize servers to execute coordinated attacks,12\n1380,WEB SERVICES,ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE,Web services can be leveraged by adversaries as part of the infrastructure to blend in with normal traffic,11\n1497,SERVER,VIRTUAL PRIVATE SERVER,Virtual Private Servers can be used as servers for various malicious activities,11\n1496,SERVER,DNS SERVER,Servers can be configured to run DNS services for command and control operations,9\n1498,SERVER,SERVERLESS,Serverless infrastructure can be used in conjunction with servers for executing operations,9\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
