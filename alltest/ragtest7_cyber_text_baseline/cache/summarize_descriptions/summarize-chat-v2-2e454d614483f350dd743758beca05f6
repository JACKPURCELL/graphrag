{"result": "Resource Forking is a technique employed by adversaries to conceal malicious code within resource forks in macOS applications, thereby evading detection. This attack method involves the creation of separate data streams that allow the hidden malicious content to remain undetected. By utilizing resource forks, which are a feature of the macOS file system, attackers can effectively hide their malicious activities from security measures.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
