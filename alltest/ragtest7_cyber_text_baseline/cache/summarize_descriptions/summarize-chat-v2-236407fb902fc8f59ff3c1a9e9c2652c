{"result": "MITIGATION METHODS encompass various strategies designed to enhance security and protect against vulnerabilities. One specific mitigation method within this framework is CODE SIGNING. Code Signing plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity of applications, thereby safeguarding them from unauthorized modifications. Additionally, it is employed as a countermeasure against specific attack techniques, such as the LC_LOAD_DYLIB Addition attack. Through these functions, Code Signing contributes significantly to the overall effectiveness of mitigation methods in maintaining application security.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
