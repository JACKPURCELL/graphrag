{"result": "Kernel Modules and Extensions is an attack technique employed by adversaries to manipulate the kernel of an operating system. This technique involves modifying the kernel to enable the automatic execution of programs during system boot. It utilizes Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs) or kernel extensions (kexts) specifically in macOS environments. By leveraging these components, attackers can gain persistent access and control over the system, making it a significant security concern.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
