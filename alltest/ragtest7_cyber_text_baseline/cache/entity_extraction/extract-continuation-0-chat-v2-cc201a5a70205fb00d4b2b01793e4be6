A login hook is a plist file that points to a specific script to execute with root privileges upon user logon. The plist file is located in the <code>/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist</code> file and can be modified using the <code>defaults</code> command-line utility. This behavior is the same for logout hooks where a script can be executed upon user logout. All hooks require administrator permissions to modify or create hooks.(Citation: Login Scripts Apple Dev)(Citation: LoginWindowScripts Apple Dev) \n\nAdversaries can add or insert a path to a malicious script in the <code>com.apple.loginwindow.plist</code> file, using the <code>LoginHook</code> or <code>LogoutHook</code> key-value pair. The malicious script is executed upon the next user login. If a login hook already exists, adversaries can add additional commands to an existing login hook. There can be only one login and logout hook on a system at a time.(Citation: S1 macOs Persistence)(Citation: Wardle Persistence Chapter)\n\n**Note:** Login hooks were deprecated in 10.11 version of macOS in favor of [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004) and [Launch Agent](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/001) \nPlatforms: macOS\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>GEO<|>macOS is an operating system developed by Apple Inc. for Macintosh computers, known for its user-friendly interface and robust security features.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOGIN HOOK<|>EVENT<|>Login Hook is an attack technique that allows adversaries to establish persistence by executing a script with root privileges upon user logon.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOGOUT HOOK<|>EVENT<|>Logout Hook is an attack technique similar to Login Hook, allowing scripts to be executed upon user logout.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLE INC.<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apple Inc. is a technology company that designs, manufactures, and sells consumer electronics, software, and online services, including the macOS operating system.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOGIN HOOK<|>MACOS<|>Login Hook is a technique that operates within the macOS environment to execute scripts upon user logon<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOGOUT HOOK<|>MACOS<|>Logout Hook is a technique that operates within the macOS environment to execute scripts upon user logout<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE INC.<|>MACOS<|>Apple Inc. is the developer of the macOS operating system<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
