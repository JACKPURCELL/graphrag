They may do this, for example, by retrieving account usernames or by using [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003). The information may be collected in a number of different ways using other Discovery techniques, because user and username details are prevalent throughout a system and include running process ownership, file/directory ownership, session information, and system logs. Adversaries may use the information from [System Owner/User Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1033) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.\n\nVarious utilities and commands may acquire this information, including <code>whoami</code>. In macOS and Linux, the currently logged in user can be identified with <code>w</code> and <code>who</code>. On macOS the <code>dscl . list /Users | grep -v '_'</code> command can also be used to enumerate user accounts. Environment variables, such as <code>%USERNAME%</code> and <code>$USER</code>, may also be used to access this information.\n\nOn network devices, [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) commands such as `show users` and `show ssh` can be used to display users currently logged into the device.(Citation: show_ssh_users_cmd_cisco)(Citation: US-CERT TA18-106A Network Infrastructure Devices 2018)\nPlatforms: Linux, macOS, Windows, Network\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SYSTEM OWNER/USER DISCOVERY<|>EVENT<|>System Owner/User Discovery is an attack technique where adversaries identify the primary user or currently logged in user of a system, and may retrieve account usernames or use OS Credential Dumping to gather this information.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>GEO<|>Linux is an operating system platform that can be targeted by the System Owner/User Discovery attack technique.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>GEO<|>macOS is an operating system platform that can be targeted by the System Owner/User Discovery attack technique.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>GEO<|>Windows is an operating system platform that can be targeted by the System Owner/User Discovery attack technique.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NETWORK<|>GEO<|>Network refers to network devices that can be targeted by the System Owner/User Discovery attack technique.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SYSTEM OWNER/USER DISCOVERY<|>LINUX<|>System Owner/User Discovery can be executed on the Linux platform to identify users<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SYSTEM OWNER/USER DISCOVERY<|>MACOS<|>System Owner/User Discovery can be executed on the macOS platform to identify users<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SYSTEM OWNER/USER DISCOVERY<|>WINDOWS<|>System Owner/User Discovery can be executed on the Windows platform to identify users<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SYSTEM OWNER/USER DISCOVERY<|>NETWORK<|>System Owner/User Discovery can be executed on network devices to identify users<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
