There are 4 mitigation methods that can mitigating the attack technique called Dynamic Data Exchange. Their names are as follows:
* Behavior Prevention on Endpoint 
* Application Isolation and Sandboxing 
* Software Configuration 
* Disable or Remove Feature or Program 

The following content describes information about mitigation methods. The format of each mitigation method's information is as follows:
Mitigation method name: ***
Mitigation method description: ***
These respectively represent the name of the mitigation method and a detailed description of how it works.

Mitigation method name: Behavior Prevention on Endpoint
Mitigation method description: Use capabilities to prevent suspicious behavior patterns from occurring on endpoint systems. This could include suspicious process, file, API call, etc. behavior.

Mitigation method name: Application Isolation and Sandboxing
Mitigation method description: Restrict execution of code to a virtual environment on or in transit to an endpoint system.

Mitigation method name: Software Configuration
Mitigation method description: Implement configuration changes to software (other than the operating system) to mitigate security risks associated to how the software operates.

Mitigation method name: Disable or Remove Feature or Program
Mitigation method description: Remove or deny access to unnecessary and potentially vulnerable software to prevent abuse by adversaries.
