Their names are as follows:\n* Remote Email Collection\n* Email Forwarding Rule\n* Local Email Collection\n\nThe following content describes information about the attack techniques. The format of each attack technique's information is as follows:\nAttack technique name: ***\nAttack technique description: ***\nPlatforms: ***\nThese respectively represent the name of the attack technique, a detailed description, and the platforms it can target.\n\nAttack technique name: Email Collection\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may target user email to collect sensitive information. Emails may contain sensitive data, including trade secrets or personal information, that can prove valuable to adversaries. Adversaries can collect or forward email from mail servers or clients. \nPlatforms: Windows, Office 365, Google Workspace, macOS, Linux\n\nAttack technique name: Remote Email Collection\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may target an Exchange server, Office 365, or Google Workspace to collect sensitive information. Adversaries may leverage a user's credentials and interact directly with the Exchange server to acquire information from within a network. Adversaries may also access externally facing Exchange services, Office 365, or Google Workspace to access email using credentials or access tokens. Tools such as [MailSniper](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0413) can be used to automate searches for specific keywords.\nPlatforms: Office 365, Windows, Google Workspace\n\nAttack technique name: Email Forwarding Rule\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may setup email forwarding rules to collect sensitive information. Adversaries may abuse email forwarding rules to monitor the activities of a victim, steal information, and further gain intelligence on the victim or the victim’s organization to use as part of further exploits or operations.(Citation: US-CERT TA18-068A 2018) Furthermore, email forwarding rules can allow adversaries to maintain persistent access to victim's emails even after compromised credentials are reset by administrators.(Citation: Pfammatter - Hidden Inbox Rules) Most email clients allow users to create inbox rules for various email functions, including forwarding to a different recipient. These rules may be created through a local email application, a web interface, or by command-line interface. Messages can be forwarded to internal or external recipients, and there are no restrictions limiting the extent of this rule. Administrators may also create forwarding rules for user accounts with the same considerations and outcomes.(Citation: Microsoft Tim McMichael Exchange Mail Forwarding 2)(Citation: Mac Forwarding Rules)\n\nAny user or administrator within the organization (or adversary with valid credentials) can create rules to automatically forward all received messages to another recipient, forward emails to different locations based on the sender, and more. Adversaries may also hide the rule by making use of the Microsoft Messaging API (MAPI) to modify the rule properties, making it hidden and not visible from Outlook, OWA or most Exchange Administration tools.(Citation: Pfammatter - Hidden Inbox Rules)\n\nIn some environments, administrators may be able to enable email forwarding rules that operate organization-wide rather than on individual inboxes. For example, Microsoft Exchange supports transport rules that evaluate all mail an organization receives against user-specified conditions, then performs a user-specified action on mail that adheres to those conditions.(Citation: Microsoft Mail Flow Rules 2023) Adversaries that abuse such features may be able to enable forwarding on all or specific mail an organization receives. \nPlatforms: Office 365, Windows, Google Workspace, macOS, Linux\n\nAttack technique name: Local Email Collection\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may target user email on local systems to collect sensitive information. Files containing email data can be acquired from a user’s local system, such as Outlook storage or cache files.\n\nOutlook stores data locally in offline data files with an extension of .ost. Outlook 2010 and later supports .ost file sizes up to 50GB, while earlier versions of Outlook support up to 20GB.(Citation: Outlook File Sizes) IMAP accounts in Outlook 2013 (and earlier) and POP accounts use Outlook Data Files (.pst) as opposed to .ost, whereas IMAP accounts in Outlook 2016 (and later) use .ost files. Both types of Outlook data files are typically stored in `C:\\Users\\<username>\\Documents\\Outlook Files` or `C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Outlook`.(Citation: Microsoft Outlook Files)\nPlatforms: Windows\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EMAIL COLLECTION<|>EVENT<|>Email Collection is an attack technique where adversaries target user email to collect sensitive information, including trade secrets or personal information, from various platforms such as Windows, Office 365, Google Workspace, macOS, and Linux.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REMOTE EMAIL COLLECTION<|>EVENT<|>Remote Email Collection is an attack technique that targets Exchange servers, Office 365, or Google Workspace to collect sensitive information using user credentials and tools like MailSniper.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMAIL FORWARDING RULE<|>EVENT<|>Email Forwarding Rule is an attack technique where adversaries set up rules to forward emails to collect sensitive information and maintain persistent access to victim's emails.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOCAL EMAIL COLLECTION<|>EVENT<|>Local Email Collection is an attack technique where adversaries target user email on local systems to collect sensitive information from files like Outlook storage or cache files.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMAIL COLLECTION<|>REMOTE EMAIL COLLECTION<|>Remote Email Collection is a specific method under the broader category of Email Collection techniques used to gather sensitive information<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMAIL COLLECTION<|>EMAIL FORWARDING RULE<|>Email Forwarding Rule is a technique that falls under the Email Collection category, focusing on monitoring and stealing information<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMAIL COLLECTION<|>LOCAL EMAIL COLLECTION<|>Local Email Collection is another method of Email Collection that targets data stored locally on user systems<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REMOTE EMAIL COLLECTION<|>EMAIL FORWARDING RULE<|>Both Remote Email Collection and Email Forwarding Rule are techniques used by adversaries to collect sensitive information from email systems<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REMOTE EMAIL COLLECTION<|>LOCAL EMAIL COLLECTION<|>Remote Email Collection and Local Email Collection are both strategies employed to gather sensitive information from different sources within email systems<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMAIL FORWARDING RULE<|>LOCAL EMAIL COLLECTION<|>Email Forwarding Rule and Local Email Collection are both attack techniques that focus on collecting sensitive information from email systems, albeit through different methods<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
