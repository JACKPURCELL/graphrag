This technique involves the acquisition of various types of infrastructure, which may include purchasing, leasing, renting, or otherwise obtaining resources necessary for targeting operations. Such resources can encompass physical or cloud servers, domain names, and third-party web services, enabling attackers to effectively execute their malicious activities.\",9\n637,BOTNET,\"A botnet is a network of compromised systems, specifically private computers infected with malicious software, that can be utilized for coordinated malicious activities, including phishing and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. These networks are controlled as a group without the knowledge of the computer owners, allowing for various cyber attacks to be executed. Essentially, a botnet serves as an attack technique that leverages a collection of infected computers to perform harmful tasks, often without the consent or awareness of the individuals whose systems have been compromised.\",5\n687,SERVER,\"The term \"\"SERVER\"\" refers to a system that provides data, resources, or services to other computers. In the context of adversary operations, servers are often utilized for hosting and orchestrating attacks. They can be either physical or virtual machines that adversaries use to stage and execute operations during cyber attacks.\",5\n1010,VIRTUAL PRIVATE SERVER,\"A Virtual Private Server (VPS) is a virtualized server that functions similarly to a dedicated server, although it is fundamentally a shared server. VPSs are commonly utilized by adversaries for hosting operations, allowing them to obscure their activities. These cloud-based servers are rented and provide a level of anonymity that can be advantageous for malicious purposes. The use of Virtual Private Servers as an attack technique can be mitigated through various methods, including pre-compromise activities aimed at reducing the risk of exploitation.\",4\n1085,DNS SERVER,\"The DNS Server is a critical component of the internet infrastructure that translates domain names into IP addresses, enabling users to access websites and services using easily memorable names instead of numerical addresses. However, adversaries may exploit DNS servers for malicious purposes, including manipulating them to facilitate command and control operations. This attack technique poses significant security risks, but it can be mitigated through various methods, including pre-compromise activities aimed at securing the DNS infrastructure against potential threats.\",3\n900,SERVERLESS,\"Serverless refers to a cloud computing execution model that enables users to run code without the need to manage servers. In this model, the cloud provider dynamically allocates machine resources, which can be exploited by adversaries. This infrastructure presents challenges in tracing adversarial activities, as it allows them to operate with a degree of anonymity. Additionally, serverless is recognized as an attack technique that necessitates specific mitigation methods to prevent initial access by adversaries. Overall, while serverless technology offers flexibility and efficiency in resource management, it also introduces unique security vulnerabilities that must be addressed.\",3\n611,DOMAINS,\"Domains are human-readable names that represent one or more IP addresses. Adversaries may acquire these domains for various targeting purposes, including phishing and command and control activities.\",2\n743,MALVERTISING,\"Malvertising is an attack technique employed by adversaries who purchase online advertisements to distribute malware to unsuspecting victims. This method often involves impersonating well-known brands to deceive users into clicking on malicious ads, thereby facilitating the spread of malware.\",2\n1173,DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE (DDOS),DDoS is a type of cyber attack that aims to make a service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources.,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n579,PRE-COMPROMISE,ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE,Pre-compromise is a mitigation method specifically designed to counter the Acquire Infrastructure attack technique,44\n564,PRE-COMPROMISE,BOTNET,Pre-compromise methods are designed to mitigate the risks associated with botnet attacks by preventing initial access,40\n572,PRE-COMPROMISE,SERVER,Pre-compromise is a mitigation method specifically designed to counter the attack technique known as Server,40\n584,PRE-COMPROMISE,VIRTUAL PRIVATE SERVER,Pre-compromise is a mitigation method specifically designed to address vulnerabilities associated with the Virtual Private Server attack technique.,39\n587,PRE-COMPROMISE,DNS SERVER,Pre-compromise is a mitigation method specifically designed to address the DNS Server attack technique,38\n581,PRE-COMPROMISE,SERVERLESS,Pre-compromise is a mitigation method specifically designed to counter the Serverless attack technique,38\n563,PRE-COMPROMISE,DOMAINS,Pre-compromise is a mitigation method specifically designed to counter the attack technique known as Domains,37\n574,PRE-COMPROMISE,MALVERTISING,Pre-compromise is a mitigation method specifically designed to counter the attack technique known as Malvertising,37\n282,ADVERSARIES,BOTNET,\"Adversaries may utilize botnets to conduct large-scale attacks, including phishing and DDoS attacks.\",22\n1620,WEB SERVICES,ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE,Web services can be leveraged by adversaries as part of the infrastructure to blend in with normal internet traffic,16\n1651,BOTNET,ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE,Botnets can be rented or purchased as part of the infrastructure adversaries acquire for launching attacks,14\n1713,SERVER,ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE,Servers are a key component of the infrastructure that adversaries may acquire for orchestrating their operations,14\n1837,ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE,VIRTUAL PRIVATE SERVER,Virtual Private Servers are often acquired by adversaries to host their operations discreetly,13\n1836,ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE,DNS SERVER,DNS servers can be manipulated as part of the infrastructure used by adversaries to conduct attacks,12\n1838,ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE,SERVERLESS,Serverless computing can be utilized by adversaries as part of their infrastructure for executing operations,12\n1624,DOMAINS,ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE,Domains can be part of the infrastructure acquired by adversaries to facilitate their targeting operations,11\n1758,MALVERTISING,ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE,\"Malvertising may utilize acquired infrastructure to distribute malware effectively, leveraging online ads to reach victims\",11\n1652,BOTNET,SERVER,Botnets often utilize servers to execute coordinated attacks and manage compromised systems.,10\n1714,SERVER,VIRTUAL PRIVATE SERVER,Adversaries may use Virtual Private Servers as part of their server infrastructure for operations.,9\n1715,SERVER,DNS SERVER,DNS servers are a type of server used for managing domain name resolutions and can be part of an adversary's infrastructure.,8\n1857,SERVERLESS,VIRTUAL PRIVATE SERVER,Serverless infrastructure can be used in conjunction with Virtual Private Servers to enhance anonymity in operations.,7\n1653,BOTNET,DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE (DDOS),Botnets are commonly used to execute DDoS attacks by flooding a target with excessive traffic.,6\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
