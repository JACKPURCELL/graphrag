However, this attack vector can be mitigated through various security measures designed to enhance the overall security posture and prevent exploitation.\",4\n877,CREATE OR MODIFY SYSTEM PROCESS,\"The \"\"CREATE OR MODIFY SYSTEM PROCESS\"\" is an attack technique employed by adversaries to establish persistence by creating or altering system-level processes to execute malicious payloads. This technique poses significant security risks, as it allows attackers to maintain control over compromised systems. However, it can be mitigated through various methods, which are detailed in the relevant documentation.\",4\n47,LAUNCH AGENT,\"The \"\"LAUNCH AGENT\"\" refers to a feature in macOS that enables user-specific scripts and programs to run automatically upon user login. This functionality has replaced the older Login Hooks that were previously used. However, it can also be exploited as an attack technique by adversaries who create or modify launch agents to execute malicious payloads. This method is employed as a means of establishing persistence on macOS systems, allowing the adversaries to repeatedly execute their malicious code. Thus, while Launch Agents serve a legitimate purpose in the macOS environment, they can also pose significant security risks when manipulated by malicious actors.\",7\n46,LAUNCH DAEMON,\"The \"\"LAUNCH DAEMON\"\" refers to a feature in macOS that enables scripts and programs to operate in the background, serving as a replacement for the deprecated Login Hooks for maintaining persistence.
