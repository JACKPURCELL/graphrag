This method significantly improves security beyond the traditional username and password approach, making it more difficult for unauthorized individuals to gain access. MFA combines various forms of identification, which may include something the user knows (like a password), something the user has (such as a physical smart card or a token generator), or something the user is (biometric verification).\n\nWhile MFA greatly increases security and helps protect against threats like password guessing and unauthorized access, it is important to note that it can still be vulnerable if session cookies are stolen. Overall, Multi-Factor Authentication serves as a critical measure in safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring that only authorized users can access specific systems.\",17\n916,ACCOUNT USE POLICIES,Account Use Policies involve configuring account features like login attempt lockouts and specific login times to mitigate risks associated with Password Guessing.,4\n917,PASSWORD GUESSING,No Description,4\n530,PASSWORD CRACKING,Password Cracking is an attack technique employed to gain unauthorized access to accounts by recovering passwords.
