{"result": "Access Control Lists (ACLs) are security features utilized in operating systems to manage permissions and access to resources. They serve as important security measures that define which users and systems are permitted to access specific resources within a system. However, ACLs are often turned off or deactivated to enhance system performance, as this can streamline operations by reducing the overhead associated with managing these permissions.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
