{"result": "Code Signing is a security measure that enforces binary and application integrity through the verification of digital signatures. This process is designed to prevent the execution of untrusted code, ensuring that only verified and trusted applications are allowed to run. By utilizing digital signature verification, Code Signing helps to mitigate risks associated with the execution of potentially harmful software.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
