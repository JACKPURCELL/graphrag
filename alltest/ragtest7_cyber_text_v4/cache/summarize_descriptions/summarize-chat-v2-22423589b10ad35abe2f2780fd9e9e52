{"result": "LSASS Memory is an attack technique that specifically targets the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) to extract sensitive information from its memory space. This memory area can contain critical credential information, making it a prime target for adversaries seeking to gain unauthorized access to systems.
