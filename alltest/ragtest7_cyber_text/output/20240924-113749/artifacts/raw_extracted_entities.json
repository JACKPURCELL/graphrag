This information can help adversaries determine which user accounts and groups are available, the membership of users in particular groups, and which users and groups have elevated permissions.\n\nAdversaries may attempt to discover group permission settings in many different ways. This data may provide the adversary with information about the compromised environment that can be used in follow-on activity and targeting.(Citation: CrowdStrike BloodHound April 2018)\nPlatforms: Windows, Azure AD, Office 365, SaaS, IaaS, Linux, macOS, Google Workspace, Containers\n\nAttack technique name: Cloud Groups\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may attempt to find cloud groups and permission settings. The knowledge of cloud permission groups can help adversaries determine the particular roles of users and groups within an environment, as well as which users are associated with a particular group.\n\nWith authenticated access there are several tools that can be used to find permissions groups. The <code>Get-MsolRole<\/code> PowerShell cmdlet can be used to obtain roles and permissions groups for Exchange and Office 365 accounts (Citation: Microsoft Msolrole)(Citation: GitHub Raindance).\n\nAzure CLI (AZ CLI) and the Google Cloud Identity Provider API also provide interfaces to obtain permissions groups. The command <code>az ad user get-member-groups<\/code> will list groups associated to a user account for Azure while the API endpoint <code>GET https:\/\/cloudidentity.googleapis.com\/v1\/groups<\/code> lists group resources available to a user for Google.(Citation: Microsoft AZ CLI)(Citation: Black Hills Red Teaming MS AD Azure, 2018)(Citation: Google Cloud Identity API Documentation) In AWS, the commands `ListRolePolicies` and `ListAttachedRolePolicies` allow users to enumerate the policies attached to a role.(Citation: Palo Alto Unit 42 Compromised Cloud Compute Credentials 2022)\n\nAdversaries may attempt to list ACLs for objects to determine the owner and other accounts with access to the object, for example, via the AWS <code>GetBucketAcl<\/code> API (Citation: AWS Get Bucket ACL). Using this information an adversary can target accounts with permissions to a given object or leverage accounts they have already compromised to access the object.\nPlatforms: Azure AD, Office 365, SaaS, IaaS, Google Workspace\n\nAttack technique name: Domain Groups\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may attempt to find domain-level groups and permission settings. The knowledge of domain-level permission groups can help adversaries determine which groups exist and which users belong to a particular group. Adversaries may use this information to determine which users have elevated permissions, such as domain administrators.\n\nCommands such as <code>net group \/domain<\/code> of the [Net](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/software\/S0039) utility,  <code>dscacheutil -q group<\/code> on macOS, and <code>ldapsearch<\/code> on Linux can list domain-level groups.\nPlatforms: Linux, macOS, Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Local Groups\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may attempt to find local system groups and permission settings. The knowledge of local system permission groups can help adversaries determine which groups exist and which users belong to a particular group.

Their names are as follows:\n* RC Scripts\n* Logon Script (Windows)\n* Network Logon Script\n* Startup Items\n* Login Hook\n\nThe following content describes information about the attack techniques. The format of each attack technique's information is as follows:\nAttack technique name: ***\nAttack technique description: ***\nPlatforms: ***\nThese respectively represent the name of the attack technique, a detailed description, and the platforms it can target.\n\nAttack technique name: Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may use scripts automatically executed at boot or logon initialization to establish persistence.(Citation: Mandiant APT29 Eye Spy Email Nov 22)(Citation: Anomali Rocke March 2019) Initialization scripts can be used to perform administrative functions, which may often execute other programs or send information to an internal logging server. These scripts can vary based on operating system and whether applied locally or remotely.  \n\nAdversaries may use these scripts to maintain persistence on a single system. Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary. \n\nAn adversary may also be able to escalate their privileges since some boot or logon initialization scripts run with higher privileges.\nPlatforms: macOS, Windows, Linux, Network\n\nAttack technique name: RC Scripts\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may establish persistence by modifying RC scripts which are executed during a Unix-like system\u2019s startup. These files allow system administrators to map and start custom services at startup for different run levels. RC scripts require root privileges to modify.\n\nAdversaries can establish persistence by adding a malicious binary path or shell commands to <code>rc.local<\/code>, <code>rc.common<\/code>, and other RC scripts specific to the Unix-like distribution.(Citation: IranThreats Kittens Dec 2017)(Citation: Intezer HiddenWasp Map 2019) Upon reboot, the system executes the script's contents as root, resulting in persistence.\n\nAdversary abuse of RC scripts is especially effective for lightweight Unix-like distributions using the root user as default, such as IoT or embedded systems.(Citation: intezer-kaiji-malware)\n\nSeveral Unix-like systems have moved to Systemd and deprecated the use of RC scripts. This is now a deprecated mechanism in macOS in favor of [Launchd](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1053\/004). (Citation: Apple Developer Doco Archive Launchd)(Citation: Startup Items) This technique can be used on Mac OS X Panther v10.3 and earlier versions which still execute the RC scripts.(Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence) To maintain backwards compatibility some systems, such as Ubuntu, will execute the RC scripts if they exist with the correct file permissions.(Citation: Ubuntu Manpage systemd rc)\nPlatforms: macOS, Linux, Network\n\nAttack technique name: Logon Script (Windows)\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may use Windows logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence. Windows allows logon scripts to be run whenever a specific user or group of users log into a system.(Citation: TechNet Logon Scripts) This is done via adding a path to a script to the <code>HKCU\\Environment\\UserInitMprLogonScript<\/code> Registry key.(Citation: Hexacorn Logon Scripts)\n\nAdversaries may use these scripts to maintain persistence on a single system. Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary. \nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Network Logon Script\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may use network logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence. Network logon scripts can be assigned using Active Directory or Group Policy Objects.(Citation: Petri Logon Script AD) These logon scripts run with the privileges of the user they are assigned to. Depending on the systems within the network, initializing one of these scripts could apply to more than one or potentially all systems.  \n \nAdversaries may use these scripts to maintain persistence on a network. Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary.\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Startup Items\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may use startup items automatically executed at boot initialization to establish persistence. Startup items execute during the final phase of the boot process and contain shell scripts or other executable files along with configuration information used by the system to determine the execution order for all startup items.(Citation: Startup Items)\n\nThis is technically a deprecated technology (superseded by [Launch Daemon](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1543\/004)), and thus the appropriate folder, <code>\/Library\/StartupItems<\/code> isn\u2019t guaranteed to exist on the system by default, but does appear to exist by default on macOS Sierra. A startup item is a directory whose executable and configuration property list (plist), <code>StartupParameters.plist<\/code>, reside in the top-level directory. \n\nAn adversary can create the appropriate folders\/files in the StartupItems directory to register their own persistence mechanism.(Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence) Additionally, since StartupItems run during the bootup phase of macOS, they will run as the elevated root user.\nPlatforms: macOS\n\nAttack technique name: Login Hook\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may use a Login Hook to establish persistence executed upon user logon. A login hook is a plist file that points to a specific script to execute with root privileges upon user logon. The plist file is located in the <code>\/Library\/Preferences\/com.apple.loginwindow.plist<\/code> file and can be modified using the

Their names are as follows:\n* Remote Email Collection\n* Email Forwarding Rule\n* Local Email Collection\n\nThe following content describes information about the attack techniques. The format of each attack technique's information is as follows:\nAttack technique name: ***\nAttack technique description: ***\nPlatforms: ***\nThese respectively represent the name of the attack technique, a detailed description, and the platforms it can target.\n\nAttack technique name: Email Collection\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may target user email to collect sensitive information. Emails may contain sensitive data, including trade secrets or personal information, that can prove valuable to adversaries. Adversaries can collect or forward email from mail servers or clients. \nPlatforms: Windows, Office 365, Google Workspace, macOS, Linux\n\nAttack technique name: Remote Email Collection\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may target an Exchange server, Office 365, or Google Workspace to collect sensitive information. Adversaries may leverage a user's credentials and interact directly with the Exchange server to acquire information from within a network. Adversaries may also access externally facing Exchange services, Office 365, or Google Workspace to access email using credentials or access tokens. Tools such as [MailSniper](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/software\/S0413) can be used to automate searches for specific keywords.\nPlatforms: Office 365, Windows, Google Workspace\n\nAttack technique name: Email Forwarding Rule\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may setup email forwarding rules to collect sensitive information. Adversaries may abuse email forwarding rules to monitor the activities of a victim, steal information, and further gain intelligence on the victim or the victim\u2019s organization to use as part of further exploits or operations.(Citation: US-CERT TA18-068A 2018) Furthermore, email forwarding rules can allow adversaries to maintain persistent access to victim's emails even after compromised credentials are reset by administrators.(Citation: Pfammatter - Hidden Inbox Rules) Most email clients allow users to create inbox rules for various email functions, including forwarding to a different recipient. These rules may be created through a local email application, a web interface, or by command-line interface. Messages can be forwarded to internal or external recipients, and there are no restrictions limiting the extent of this rule. Administrators may also create forwarding rules for user accounts with the same considerations and outcomes.(Citation: Microsoft Tim McMichael Exchange Mail Forwarding 2)(Citation: Mac Forwarding Rules)\n\nAny user or administrator within the organization (or adversary with valid credentials) can create rules to automatically forward all received messages to another recipient, forward emails to different locations based on the sender, and more. Adversaries may also hide the rule by making use of the Microsoft Messaging API (MAPI) to modify the rule properties, making it hidden and not visible from Outlook, OWA or most Exchange Administration tools.(Citation: Pfammatter - Hidden Inbox Rules)\n\nIn some environments, administrators may be able to enable email forwarding rules that operate organization-wide rather than on individual inboxes. For example, Microsoft Exchange supports transport rules that evaluate all mail an organization receives against user-specified conditions, then performs a user-specified action on mail that adheres to those conditions.(Citation: Microsoft Mail Flow Rules 2023) Adversaries that abuse such features may be able to enable forwarding on all or specific mail an organization receives. \nPlatforms: Office 365, Windows, Google Workspace, macOS, Linux\n\nAttack technique name: Local Email Collection\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may target user email on local systems to collect sensitive information. Files containing email data can be acquired from a user\u2019s local system, such as Outlook storage or cache files.\n\nOutlook stores data locally in offline data files with an extension of .ost. Outlook 2010 and later supports .ost file sizes up to 50GB, while earlier versions of Outlook support up to 20GB.(Citation: Outlook File Sizes) IMAP accounts in Outlook 2013 (and earlier) and POP accounts use Outlook Data Files (.pst) as opposed to .ost, whereas IMAP accounts in Outlook 2016 (and later) use .ost files. Both types of Outlook data files are typically stored in `C:\\Users\\<username>\\Documents\\Outlook Files` or `C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Outlook`.(Citation: Microsoft Outlook Files)\nPlatforms: Windows\n","chunk_id":"bd54d4d14f83ce917a1bad5632dd9301","document_ids":["08372cd7d40a9429a95587cb68ee9f8f"],"n_tokens":915,"entities":[{"name":"EMAIL

Their names are as follows:\n* Create Snapshot\n* Delete Cloud Instance\n* Revert Cloud Instance\n* Create Cloud Instance\n* Modify Cloud Compute Configurations\n\nThe following content describes information about the attack techniques. The format of each attack technique's information is as follows:\nAttack technique name: ***\nAttack technique description: ***\nPlatforms: ***\nThese respectively represent the name of the attack technique, a detailed description, and the platforms it can target.\n\nAttack technique name: Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure\nAttack technique description: An adversary may attempt to modify a cloud account's compute service infrastructure to evade defenses. A modification to the compute service infrastructure can include the creation, deletion, or modification of one or more components such as compute instances, virtual machines, and snapshots.\n\nPermissions gained from the modification of infrastructure components may bypass restrictions that prevent access to existing infrastructure. Modifying infrastructure components may also allow an adversary to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence.(Citation: Mandiant M-Trends 2020)\nPlatforms: IaaS\n\nAttack technique name: Create Snapshot\nAttack technique description: An adversary may create a snapshot or data backup within a cloud account to evade defenses. A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of an existing cloud compute component such as a virtual machine (VM), virtual hard drive, or volume. An adversary may leverage permissions to create a snapshot in order to bypass restrictions that prevent access to existing compute service infrastructure, unlike in [Revert Cloud Instance](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1578\/004) where an adversary may revert to a snapshot to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence.\n\nAn adversary may [Create Cloud Instance](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1578\/002), mount one or more created snapshots to that instance, and then apply a policy that allows the adversary access to the created instance, such as a firewall policy that allows them inbound and outbound SSH access.(Citation: Mandiant M-Trends 2020)\nPlatforms: IaaS\n\nAttack technique name: Delete Cloud Instance\nAttack technique description: An adversary may delete a cloud instance after they have performed malicious activities in an attempt to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence.  Deleting an instance or virtual machine can remove valuable forensic artifacts and other evidence of suspicious behavior if the instance is not recoverable.\n\nAn adversary may also [Create Cloud Instance](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1578\/002) and later terminate the instance after achieving their objectives.(Citation: Mandiant M-Trends 2020)\nPlatforms: IaaS\n\nAttack technique name: Revert Cloud Instance\nAttack technique description: An adversary may revert changes made to a cloud instance after they have performed malicious activities in attempt to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence. In highly virtualized environments, such as cloud-based infrastructure, this may be accomplished by restoring virtual machine (VM) or data storage snapshots through the cloud management dashboard or cloud APIs.\n\nAnother variation of this technique is to utilize temporary storage attached to the compute instance. Most cloud providers provide various types of storage including persistent, local, and\/or ephemeral, with the ephemeral types often reset upon stop\/restart of the VM.(Citation: Tech Republic - Restore AWS Snapshots)(Citation: Google - Restore Cloud Snapshot)\nPlatforms: IaaS\n\nAttack technique name: Create Cloud Instance\nAttack technique description: An adversary may create a new instance or virtual machine (VM) within the compute service of a cloud account to evade defenses. Creating a new instance may allow an adversary to bypass firewall rules and permissions that exist on instances currently residing within an account.

These settings may include service quotas, subscription associations, tenant-wide policies, or other configurations that impact available compute. Such modifications may allow adversaries to abuse the victim\u2019s compute resources to achieve their goals, potentially without affecting the execution of running instances and\/or revealing their activities to the victim.\n\nFor example, cloud providers often limit customer usage of compute resources via quotas. Customers may request adjustments to these quotas to support increased computing needs, though these adjustments may require approval from the cloud provider. Adversaries who compromise a cloud environment may similarly request quota adjustments in order to support their activities, such as enabling additional [Resource Hijacking](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1496) without raising suspicion by using up a victim\u2019s entire quota.(Citation: Microsoft Cryptojacking 2023) Adversaries may also increase allowed resource usage by modifying any tenant-wide policies that limit the sizes of deployed virtual machines.(Citation: Microsoft Azure Policy)\n\nAdversaries may also modify settings that affect where cloud resources can be deployed, such as enabling [Unused\/Unsupported Cloud Regions](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1535). In Azure environments, an adversary who has gained access to a Global Administrator account may create new subscriptions in which to deploy resources, or engage in subscription hijacking by

Their names are as follows:\n\nThe following content describes information about the attack techniques. The format of each attack technique's information is as follows:\nAttack technique name: ***\nAttack technique description: ***\nPlatforms: ***\nThese respectively represent the name of the attack technique, a detailed description, and the platforms it can target.\n\nAttack technique name: Steal Web Session Cookie\nAttack technique description: An adversary may steal web application or service session cookies and use them to gain access to web applications or Internet services as an authenticated user without needing credentials. Web applications and services often use session cookies as an authentication token after a user has authenticated to a website.\n\nCookies are often valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used. Cookies can be found on disk, in the process memory of the browser, and in network traffic to remote systems. Additionally, other applications on the targets machine might store sensitive authentication cookies in memory (e.g. apps which authenticate to cloud services). Session cookies can be used to bypasses some multi-factor authentication protocols.(Citation: Pass The Cookie)\n\nThere are several examples of malware targeting cookies from web browsers on the local system.(Citation: Kaspersky TajMahal April 2019)(Citation: Unit 42 Mac Crypto Cookies January 2019) Adversaries may also steal cookies by injecting malicious JavaScript content into websites or relying on [User Execution](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1204) by tricking victims into running malicious JavaScript in their browser.(Citation: Talos Roblox Scam 2023)(Citation: Krebs Discord Bookmarks 2023)\n\nThere are also open source frameworks such as `Evilginx2` and `Muraena` that can gather session cookies through a malicious proxy (e.g., [Adversary-in-the-Middle](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1557)) that can be set up by an adversary and used in phishing campaigns.(Citation: Github evilginx2)(Citation: GitHub Mauraena)\n\nAfter an adversary acquires a valid cookie, they can then perform a [Web Session Cookie](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1550\/004) technique to login to the corresponding web application.\nPlatforms: Linux, macOS, Windows, Office 365, SaaS, Google Workspace\n","chunk_id":"ea89ec196c89cbe0497af5d7d8603123","document_ids":["25a2a8de2cfa5a6b23857605a803618c"],"n_tokens":499,"entities":[{"name":"STEAL WEB SESSION

Their names are as follows:\n* Shortcut Modification\n* Kernel Modules and Extensions\n* Re-opened Applications\n* Winlogon Helper DLL\n* Security Support Provider\n* Registry Run Keys \/ Startup Folder\n* LSASS Driver\n* Print Processors\n* Active Setup\n* Login Items\n* XDG Autostart Entries\n* Time Providers\n* Authentication Package\n* Port Monitors\n\nThe following content describes information about the attack techniques. The format of each attack technique's information is as follows:\nAttack technique name: ***\nAttack technique description: ***\nPlatforms: ***\nThese respectively represent the name of the attack technique, a detailed description, and the platforms it can target.\n\nAttack technique name: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may configure system settings to automatically execute a program during system boot or logon to maintain persistence or gain higher-level privileges on compromised systems. Operating systems may have mechanisms for automatically running a program on system boot or account logon.(Citation: Microsoft Run Key)(Citation: MSDN Authentication Packages)(Citation: Microsoft TimeProvider)(Citation: Cylance Reg Persistence Sept 2013)(Citation: Linux Kernel Programming) These mechanisms may include automatically executing programs that are placed in specially designated directories or are referenced by repositories that store configuration information, such as the Windows Registry. An adversary may achieve the same goal by modifying or extending features of the kernel.\n\nSince some boot or logon autostart programs run with higher privileges, an adversary may leverage these to elevate privileges.\nPlatforms: Linux, macOS, Windows, Network\n\nAttack technique name: Shortcut Modification\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may create or modify shortcuts that can execute a program during system boot or user login. Shortcuts or symbolic links are used to reference other files or programs that will be opened or executed when the shortcut is clicked or executed by a system startup process.\n\nAdversaries may abuse shortcuts in the startup folder to execute their tools and achieve persistence.(Citation: Shortcut for Persistence ) Although often used as payloads in an infection chain (e.g. [Spearphishing Attachment](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1566\/001)), adversaries may also create a new shortcut as a means of indirection, while also abusing [Masquerading](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1036) to make the malicious shortcut appear as a legitimate program. Adversaries can also edit the target path or entirely replace an existing shortcut so their malware will be executed instead of the intended legitimate program.\n\nShortcuts can also be abused to establish persistence by implementing other methods. For example, LNK browser extensions may be modified (e.g. [Browser Extensions](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1176)) to persistently launch malware.\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Kernel Modules and Extensions\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may modify the kernel to automatically execute programs on system boot. Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs) are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. For example, one type of module is the device driver, which allows the kernel to access hardware connected to the system.(Citation: Linux Kernel Programming)\u00a0\n\nWhen used maliciously, LKMs can be a type of kernel-mode [Rootkit](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1014) that run with the highest operating system privilege (Ring 0).(Citation: Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide)\u00a0Common features of LKM based rootkits include: hiding itself, selective hiding of files, processes and network activity, as well as log tampering, providing authenticated backdoors, and enabling root access to non-privileged users.(Citation: iDefense Rootkit Overview)\n\nKernel extensions, also called kext, are used in macOS to load functionality onto a system similar to LKMs for Linux. Since the kernel is responsible for enforcing security and the kernel extensions run as apart of the kernel, kexts are not governed by macOS security policies. Kexts are loaded and unloaded through <code>kextload<\/code> and <code>kextunload<\/code> commands. Kexts need to be signed with a developer ID that is granted privileges by Apple allowing it to sign Kernel extensions. Developers without these privileges may still sign kexts but they will not load unless SIP is disabled. If SIP is enabled, the kext signature is verified before being added to the AuxKC.(Citation: System and kernel extensions in macOS)\n\nSince macOS Catalina 10.15, kernel extensions have been deprecated in favor of System Extensions. However, kexts are still allowed as \"Legacy System Extensions\" since there is no System Extension for Kernel Programming Interfaces.(Citation: Apple Kernel Extension Deprecation)\n\nAdversaries can use LKMs and kexts to conduct [Persistence](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/tactics\/TA0003) and\/or [Privilege Escalation](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/tactics\/TA0004) on a system. Examples have been found in the wild, and there are some relevant open source projects as well.(Citation: Volatility Phalanx2)(Citation: CrowdStrike Linux Rootkit)(Citation: GitHub Reptile)(Citation:

Registry entries in <code>HKLM\\Software[\\\\Wow6432Node\\\\]\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\<\/code> and <code>HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\<\/code> are used to manage additional helper programs and functionalities that support Winlogon.(Citation: Cylance Reg Persistence Sept 2013) \n\nMalicious modifications to these Registry keys may cause Winlogon to load and execute malicious DLLs and\/or executables. Specifically, the following subkeys have been known to be possibly vulnerable to abuse: (Citation: Cylance Reg Persistence Sept 2013)\n\n* Winlogon\\Notify - points to notification package DLLs that handle Winlogon events\n* Winlogon\\Userinit - points to userinit.exe, the user initialization program executed when a user logs on\n* Winlogon\\Shell - points to explorer.exe, the system shell executed when a user logs on\n\nAdversaries may take advantage of these features to repeatedly execute malicious code and establish persistence.\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Security Support Provider\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may abuse security support providers (SSPs) to execute DLLs when the system boots. Windows SSP DLLs are loaded into the Local Security Authority (LSA) process at system start. Once loaded into the LSA, SSP DLLs have access to encrypted and plaintext passwords that are stored in Windows, such as any logged-on user's Domain password or smart card PINs.\n\nThe SSP configuration is stored in two Registry keys: <code>HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\\Security Packages<\/code> and <code>HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\\OSConfig\\Security Packages<\/code>. An adversary may modify these Registry keys to add new SSPs, which will be loaded the next time the system boots, or when the AddSecurityPackage Windows API function is called.(Citation: Graeber 2014)\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Registry Run Keys \/ Startup Folder\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a program to a startup folder or referencing it with a Registry run key. Adding an entry to the \"run keys\" in the Registry or startup folder will cause the program referenced to be executed when a user logs in.(Citation: Microsoft Run Key) These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.\n\nThe following run keys are created by default on Windows systems:\n\n* <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run<\/code>\n* <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce<\/code>\n* <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run<\/code>\n* <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce<\/code>\n\nRun keys may exist under multiple hives.(Citation: Microsoft Wow6432Node 2018)(Citation: Malwarebytes Wow6432Node 2016) The <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnceEx<\/code> is also available but is not created by default on Windows Vista and newer. Registry run key entries can reference programs directly or list them as a dependency.(Citation: Microsoft Run Key) For example, it is possible to load a DLL at logon using a \"Depend\" key with RunOnceEx: <code>reg add HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnceEx\\0001\\Depend \/v 1 \/d \"C:\\temp\\evil[.]dll\"<\/code> (Citation: Oddvar Moe RunOnceEx Mar 2018)\n\nPlacing a program within a startup folder will also cause that program to execute when a user logs in. There is a startup folder location for individual user accounts as well as a system-wide startup folder","chunk_id":"1db27b59d87b40509ad90d675991e54c","document_ids":["36562b7eef9f6538348686b760d1b3e7"],"n_tokens":1200,"entities":[{"name":"CROWDSTRIKE","type":"ORGANIZATION","description":"CrowdStrike

Active Setup is a Windows mechanism that is used to execute programs when a user logs in. The value stored in the Registry key will be executed after a user logs into the computer.(Citation: Klein Active Setup 2010) These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.\n\nAdversaries may abuse Active Setup by creating a key under <code> HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Active Setup\\Installed Components\\<\/code> and setting a malicious value for <code>StubPath<\/code>. This value will serve as the program that will be executed when a user logs into the computer.(Citation: Mandiant Glyer APT 2010)(Citation: Citizenlab Packrat 2015)(Citation: FireEye CFR Watering Hole 2012)(Citation: SECURELIST Bright Star 2015)(Citation: paloalto Tropic Trooper 2016)\n\nAdversaries can abuse these components to execute malware, such as remote access tools, to maintain persistence through system reboots. Adversaries may also use [Masquerading](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1036) to make the Registry entries look as if they are associated with legitimate programs.\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Login Items\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may add login items to execute upon user login to gain persistence or escalate privileges. Login items are applications, documents, folders, or server connections that are automatically launched when a user logs in.(Citation: Open Login Items Apple) Login items can be added via a shared file list or Service Management Framework.(Citation: Adding Login Items) Shared file list login items can be set using scripting languages such as [AppleScript](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1059\/002), whereas the Service Management Framework uses the API call <code>SMLoginItemSetEnabled<\/code>.\n\nLogin items installed using the Service Management Framework leverage <code>launchd<\/code>, are not visible in the System Preferences, and can only be removed by the application that created them.(Citation: Adding Login Items)(Citation: SMLoginItemSetEnabled Schroeder 2013) Login items created using a shared file list are visible in System Preferences, can hide the application when it launches, and are executed through LaunchServices, not launchd, to open applications, documents, or URLs without using Finder.(Citation: Launch Services Apple Developer) Users and applications use login items to configure their user environment to launch commonly used services or applications, such as email, chat, and music applications.\n\nAdversaries can utilize [AppleScript](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1059\/002) and [Native API](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1106) calls to create a login item to spawn malicious executables.(Citation: ELC Running at startup) Prior to version 10.5 on macOS, adversaries can add login items by using [AppleScript](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1059\/002) to send an Apple events to the \u201cSystem Events\u201d process, which has an AppleScript dictionary for manipulating login items.(Citation: Login Items AE) Adversaries can use a command such as <code>tell application \u201cSystem Events\u201d to make login item at end with properties \/path\/to\/executable<\/code>.(Citation: Startup Items Eclectic)(Citation: hexed osx.dok analysis 2019)(Citation: Add List Remove Login Items Apple Script) This command adds the path of the malicious executable to the login item file list located in <code>~\/Library\/Application Support\/com.apple.backgroundtaskmanagementagent\/backgrounditems.btm<\/code>.(Citation: Startup Items Eclectic) Adversaries can also use login items to launch executables that can be used to control the victim system remotely or as a means to gain privilege escalation by prompting for user credentials.(Citation: objsee mac malware 2017)(Citation: CheckPoint Dok)(Citation: objsee netwire backdoor 2019)\nPlatforms: macOS\n\nAttack technique name: XDG Autostart Entries\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may add or modify XDG Autostart Entries to execute malicious programs or commands when a user\u2019s desktop environment is loaded at login. XDG Autostart entries are available for any XDG-compliant Linux system. XDG Autostart entries use Desktop Entry files (`.desktop`) to configure the user\u2019s desktop environment upon user login. These configuration files determine what applications launch upon user login, define associated applications to open specific file types, and define applications used to open removable media.(Citation: Free Desktop Application Autostart Feb 2006)(Citation: Free Desktop Entry Keys)\n\nAdversaries may abuse this feature to establish persistence by adding a path to a malicious binary or command to the `Exec` directive in the `.desktop` configuration file.

{"id":"07969a79a1dda4040e5d75c67b167c1d","chunk":" 2006)(Citation: Free Desktop Entry Keys)\n\nAdversaries may abuse this feature to establish persistence by adding a path to a malicious binary or command to the `Exec` directive in the `.desktop` configuration file. When the user\u2019s desktop environment is loaded at user login, the `.desktop` files located in the XDG Autostart directories are automatically executed. System-wide Autostart entries are located in the `\/etc\/xdg\/autostart` directory while the user entries are located in the `~\/.config\/autostart` directory.\n\nAdversaries may combine this technique with [Masquerading](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1036) to blend malicious Autostart entries with legitimate programs.(Citation: Red Canary Netwire Linux 2022)\nPlatforms: Linux\n\nAttack technique name: Time Providers\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may abuse time providers to execute DLLs when the system boots. The Windows Time service (W32Time) enables time synchronization across and within domains.(Citation: Microsoft W32Time Feb 2018) W32Time time providers are responsible for retrieving time stamps from hardware\/network resources and outputting these values to other network clients.(Citation: Microsoft TimeProvider)\n\nTime providers are implemented as dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are registered in the subkeys of `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\W32Time\\TimeProviders\\`.(Citation: Microsoft TimeProvider) The time provider manager, directed by the service control manager, loads and starts time providers listed and enabled under this key at system startup and\/or whenever parameters are changed.(Citation: Microsoft TimeProvider)\n\nAdversaries may abuse this architecture to establish persistence, specifically by creating a new arbitrarily named subkey  pointing to a malicious DLL in the `DllName` value. Administrator privileges are required for time provider registration, though execution will run in context of the Local Service account.(Citation: Github W32Time Oct 2017)\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Authentication Package\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may abuse authentication packages to execute DLLs when the system boots. Windows authentication package DLLs are loaded by the Local Security Authority (LSA) process at system start. They provide support for multiple logon processes and multiple security protocols to the operating system.(Citation: MSDN Authentication Packages)\n\nAdversaries can use the autostart mechanism provided by LSA authentication packages for persistence by placing a reference to a binary in the Windows Registry location <code>HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\\<\/code> with the key value of <code>\"Authentication Packages\"=&lt;target binary&gt;<\/code>. The binary will then be executed by the system when the authentication packages are loaded.\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Port Monitors\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may use port monitors to run an adversary supplied DLL during system boot for persistence or privilege escalation. A port monitor can be set through the <code>AddMonitor<\/code> API call to set a DLL to be loaded at startup.(Citation: AddMonitor) This DLL can be located in <code>C:\\Windows\\System32<\/code> and will be loaded and run by the print spooler service, `spoolsv.exe`, under SYSTEM level permissions on boot.(Citation: Bloxham) \n\nAlternatively, an arbitrary DLL can be loaded if permissions allow writing a fully-qualified pathname for that DLL to the `Driver` value of an existing or new arbitrarily named subkey of <code>HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Print\\Monitors<\/code>. The Registry key contains entries for the following:\n\n* Local Port\n* Standard TCP\/IP Port\n* USB Monitor\n* WSD Port\n\nPlatforms:

WMI is designed for programmers and is the infrastructure for management data and operations on Windows systems.(Citation: WMI 1-3) WMI is an administration feature that provides a uniform environment to access Windows system components.\n\nThe WMI service enables both local and remote access, though the latter is facilitated by [Remote Services](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1021) such as [Distributed Component Object Model](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1021\/003) and [Windows Remote Management](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1021\/006).(Citation: WMI 1-3) Remote WMI over DCOM operates using port 135, whereas WMI over WinRM operates over port 5985 when using HTTP and 5986 for HTTPS.(Citation: WMI 1-3) (Citation: Mandiant WMI)\n\nAn adversary can use WMI to interact with local and remote systems and use it as a means to execute various behaviors, such as gathering information for [Discovery](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/tactics\/TA0007) as well as [Execution](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/tactics\/TA0002) of commands and payloads.(Citation: Mandiant WMI) For example, `wmic.exe` can be abused by an adversary to delete shadow copies with the command `wmic.exe Shadowcopy Delete` (i.e., [Inhibit System Recovery](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1490)).(Citation: WMI 6)\n\n**Note:** `wmic.exe` is deprecated as of January of 2024, with the WMIC feature being \u201cdisabled by default\u201d on Windows 11+. WMIC will be removed from subsequent Windows releases and replaced by [PowerShell](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1059\/001) as the primary WMI interface.(Citation: WMI 7,8) In addition to

{"id":"55dd0a5c224b77d9f1bff2d1804cbbbb","chunk":"There are 5 sub attack techniques of the attack technique called Create or Modify System Process. Their names are as follows:\n* Launch Daemon\n* Container Service\n* Launch Agent\n* Systemd Service\n* Windows Service\n\nThe following content describes information about the attack techniques. The format of each attack technique's information is as follows:\nAttack technique name: ***\nAttack technique description: ***\nPlatforms: ***\nThese respectively represent the name of the attack technique, a detailed description, and the platforms it can target.\n\nAttack technique name: Create or Modify System Process\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may create or modify system-level processes to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. When operating systems boot up, they can start processes that perform background system functions. On Windows and Linux, these system processes are referred to as services.(Citation: TechNet Services) On macOS, launchd processes known as [Launch Daemon](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1543\/004) and [Launch Agent](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1543\/001) are run to finish system initialization and load user specific parameters.(Citation: AppleDocs Launch Agent Daemons) \n\nAdversaries may install new services, daemons, or agents that can be configured to execute at startup or a repeatable interval in order to establish persistence. Similarly, adversaries may modify existing services, daemons, or agents to achieve the same effect.  \n\nServices, daemons, or agents may be created with administrator privileges but executed under root\/SYSTEM privileges. Adversaries may leverage this functionality to create or modify system processes in order to escalate privileges.(Citation: OSX Malware Detection)  \nPlatforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, Containers\n\nAttack technique name: Launch Daemon\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may create or modify Launch Daemons to execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. Launch Daemons are plist files used to interact with Launchd, the service management framework used by macOS. Launch Daemons require elevated privileges to install, are executed for every user on a system prior to login, and run in the background without the need for user interaction. During the macOS initialization startup, the launchd process loads the parameters for launch-on-demand system-level daemons from plist files found in <code>\/System\/Library\/LaunchDaemons\/<\/code> and <code>\/Library\/LaunchDaemons\/<\/code>. Required Launch Daemons parameters include a <code>Label<\/code> to identify the task, <code>Program<\/code> to provide a path to the executable, and <code>RunAtLoad<\/code> to specify when the task is run. Launch Daemons are often used to provide access to shared resources, updates to software, or conduct automation tasks.(Citation: AppleDocs Launch Agent Daemons)(Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence)(Citation: launchd Keywords for plists)\n\nAdversaries may install a Launch Daemon configured to execute at startup by using the <code>RunAtLoad<\/code> parameter set to <code>true<\/code> and the <code>Program<\/code> parameter set to the malicious executable path. The daemon name may be disguised by using a name from a related operating system or benign software (i.e. [Masquerading](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1036)). When the Launch Daemon is executed, the program inherits administrative permissions.(Citation: WireLurker)(Citation: OSX Malware Detection)\n\nAdditionally, system configuration changes (such as the installation of third party package managing software) may cause folders such as <code>usr\/local\/bin<\/code> to become globally writeable. So, it is possible for poor configurations to allow an adversary to modify executables referenced by current Launch Daemon's plist files.(Citation: LaunchDaemon Hijacking)(Citation: sentinelone macos persist Jun 2019)\nPlatforms: macOS\n\nAttack technique name: Container Service\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may create or modify container or container cluster management tools that run as daemons, agents, or services on individual hosts. These include software for creating and managing individual containers, such as Docker and Podman, as well as container cluster node-level agents such as kubelet. By modifying these services, an adversary may be able to achieve persistence or escalate their privileges on a host.\n\nFor example, by using the `docker run` or `podman run` command with the `restart=always` directive, a container can be configured to persistently restart on the host.(Citation: AquaSec TeamTNT 2023) A user with access to the (rootful) docker command may also be able to escalate their privileges on the host.(Citation: GTFOBins Docker)\n\nIn Kubernetes environments, DaemonSets allow an adversary to persistently [Deploy Container](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1610)s on all nodes, including ones added later to the cluster.(Citation: Aquasec Kubernetes Attack 2023)(Citation: Kubernetes DaemonSet) Pods can also be deployed to specific nodes using the `nodeSelector` or `nodeName` fields in the pod spec.(Citation: Kubernetes Assigning Pods to Nodes)(Citation: AppSecco Kubernetes Namespace Breakout 2020)\n\nNote that containers can also be configured to run as [Systemd Service](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1543\/002)s.(Citation: Podman Systemd)(Citation: Docker Systemd)\nPlatforms: Containers\n\nAttack technique name: Launch Agent\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may create or modify launch agents to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. When a user logs in, a per-user launchd process is started which loads the parameters for each launch-on-demand user agent from the property list (.plist) file found in

When a user logs in, a per-user launchd process is started which loads the parameters for each launch-on-demand user agent from the property list (.plist) file found in <code>\/System\/Library\/LaunchAgents<\/code>, <code>\/Library\/LaunchAgents<\/code>, and <code>~\/Library\/LaunchAgents<\/code>.(Citation: AppleDocs Launch Agent Daemons)(Citation: OSX Keydnap malware) (Citation: Antiquated Mac Malware) Property list files use the <code>Label<\/code>, <code>ProgramArguments <\/code>, and <code>RunAtLoad<\/code> keys to identify the Launch Agent's name, executable location, and execution time.(Citation: OSX.Dok Malware) Launch Agents are often installed to perform updates to programs, launch user specified programs at login, or to conduct other developer tasks.\n\n Launch Agents can also be executed using the [Launchctl](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1569\/001) command.\n \nAdversaries may install a new Launch Agent that executes at login by placing a .plist file into the appropriate folders with the <code>RunAtLoad<\/code> or <code>KeepAlive<\/code> keys set to <code>true<\/code>.(Citation: Sofacy Komplex Trojan)(Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence) The Launch Agent name may be disguised by using a name from the related operating system or benign software. Launch Agents are created with user level privileges and execute with user level permissions.(Citation: OSX Malware Detection)(Citation: OceanLotus for OS X) \nPlatforms: macOS\n\nAttack technique name: Systemd Service\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may create or modify systemd services to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. Systemd is a system and service manager commonly used for managing background daemon processes (also known as services) and other system resources.(Citation: Linux man-pages: systemd January 2014) Systemd is the default initialization (init) system on many Linux distributions replacing legacy init systems, including SysVinit and Upstart, while remaining backwards compatible.  \n\nSystemd utilizes unit configuration files with the `.service` file extension to encode information about a service's process. By default, system level unit files are stored in the `\/systemd\/system` directory of the root owned directories (`\/`). User level unit files are stored in the `\/systemd\/user` directories of the user owned directories (`$HOME`).(Citation: lambert systemd 2022) \n\nInside the `.service` unit files, the following directives are used to execute commands:(Citation: freedesktop systemd.service)  \n\n* `ExecStart`, `ExecStartPre`, and `ExecStartPost` directives execute when a service is started manually by `systemctl` or on system start if the service is set to automatically start.\n* `ExecReload` directive executes when a service restarts. \n* `ExecStop`, `ExecStopPre`, and `ExecStopPost` directives execute when a service is stopped.  \n\nAdversaries have created new service files, altered the commands a `.service` file\u2019s directive executes, and modified the user directive a `.service` file executes as, which could result in privilege escalation. Adversaries may also place symbolic links in these directories, enabling systemd to find these payloads regardless of where they reside on the filesystem.(Citation: Anomali Rocke March 2019)(Citation: airwalk backdoor unix systems)(Citation: Rapid7 Service Persistence 22JUNE2016) \n\nThe .service file\u2019s User directive can be used to run service as a specific user, which could result in privilege escalation based on specific user\/group permissions. \nPlatforms: Linux\n\nAttack technique name: Windows Service\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may create or modify Windows services to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. When Windows boots up, it starts programs or applications called services that perform background system functions.(Citation: TechNet Services) Windows service configuration information, including the file path to the service's executable or recovery programs\/commands, is stored in the Windows Registry.\n\nAdversaries may install a new service or modify an existing service to execute at startup in order to persist on a system. Service configurations can be set or modified using system utilities (such as sc.exe), by directly modifying the Registry, or by interacting directly with the Windows API. \n\nAdversaries may also use services to install and execute malicious drivers. For example, after dropping a driver file (ex: `.sys`) to disk, the payload can be loaded and registered via [Native API](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1106) functions such as `CreateServiceW()` (or manually via functions such as `ZwLoadDriver()` and `ZwSetValueKey()`), by creating the required service Registry values (i.e. [Modify Registry](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1112)), or by using command-line utilities such as `PnPUtil.exe`.(Citation: Symantec W.32 Stuxnet Dossier)(Citation: Crowdstrike DriveSlayer February 2022)(Citation: Unit42 AcidBox June 2020) Adversaries may leverage these drivers as [Rootkit](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1014)s to hide the presence of malicious activity on a system.

They may do this, for example, by retrieving account usernames or by using [OS Credential Dumping](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1003). The information may be collected in a number of different ways using other Discovery techniques, because user and username details are prevalent throughout a system and include running process ownership, file\/directory ownership, session information, and system logs. Adversaries may use the information from [System Owner\/User Discovery](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1033) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and\/or attempts specific actions.\n\nVarious utilities and commands may acquire this information, including <code>whoami<\/code>. In macOS and Linux, the currently logged in user can be identified with <code>w<\/code> and <code>who<\/code>. On macOS the <code>dscl . list \/Users | grep -v '_'<\/code> command can also be used to enumerate user accounts.

{"id":"1e2396bfd3f4ef37fe1ab3735a5bc3fb","chunk":"There are 3 sub attack techniques of the attack technique called Adversary-in-the-Middle. Their names are as follows:\n* DHCP Spoofing\n* ARP Cache Poisoning\n* LLMNR\/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay\n\nThe following content describes information about the attack techniques. The format of each attack technique's information is as follows:\nAttack technique name: ***\nAttack technique description: ***\nPlatforms: ***\nThese respectively represent the name of the attack technique, a detailed description, and the platforms it can target.\n\nAttack technique name: Adversary-in-the-Middle\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices using an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) technique to support follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1040), [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1565\/002), or replay attacks ([Exploitation for Credential Access](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1212)). By abusing features of common networking protocols that can determine the flow of network traffic (e.g. ARP, DNS, LLMNR, etc.), adversaries may force a device to communicate through an adversary controlled system so they can collect information or perform additional actions.(Citation: Rapid7 MiTM Basics)\n\nFor example, adversaries may manipulate victim DNS settings to enable other malicious activities such as preventing\/redirecting users from accessing legitimate sites and\/or pushing additional malware.(Citation: ttint_rat)(Citation: dns_changer_trojans)(Citation: ad_blocker_with_miner) Adversaries may also manipulate DNS and leverage their position in order to intercept user credentials, including access tokens ([Steal Application Access Token](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1528)) and session cookies ([Steal Web Session Cookie](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1539)).(Citation: volexity_0day_sophos_FW)(Citation: Token tactics) [Downgrade Attack](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1562\/010)s can also be used to establish an AiTM position, such as by negotiating a less secure, deprecated, or weaker version of communication protocol (SSL\/TLS) or encryption algorithm.(Citation: mitm_tls_downgrade_att)(Citation: taxonomy_downgrade_att_tls)(Citation: tlseminar_downgrade_att)\n\nAdversaries may also leverage the AiTM position to attempt to monitor and\/or modify traffic, such as in [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1565\/002). Adversaries can setup a position similar to AiTM to prevent traffic from flowing to the appropriate destination, potentially to [Impair Defenses](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1562) and\/or in support of a [Network Denial of Service](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1498).\nPlatforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, Network\n\nAttack technique name: DHCP Spoofing\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may redirect network traffic to adversary-owned systems by spoofing Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) traffic and acting as a malicious DHCP server on the victim network. By achieving the adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) position, adversaries may collect network communications, including passed credentials, especially those sent over insecure, unencrypted protocols. This may also enable follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1040) or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1565\/002).\n\nDHCP is based on a client-server model and has two functionalities: a protocol for providing network configuration settings from a DHCP server to a client and a mechanism for allocating network addresses to clients.(Citation: rfc2131) The typical server-client interaction is as follows: \n\n1. The client broadcasts a `DISCOVER` message.\n\n2. The server responds with an `OFFER` message, which includes an available network address. \n\n3. The client broadcasts a `REQUEST` message, which includes the network address offered. \n\n4. The server acknowledges with an `ACK` message and the client receives the network configuration parameters.\n\nAdversaries may spoof as a rogue DHCP server on the victim network, from which legitimate hosts may receive malicious network configurations. For example, malware can act as a DHCP server and provide adversary-owned DNS servers to the victimized computers.(Citation: new_rogue_DHCP_serv_malware)(Citation: w32.tidserv.g) Through the malicious network configurations, an adversary may achieve the AiTM position, route client traffic through adversary-controlled systems, and collect information from the client network.\n\nDHCPv6 clients can receive network configuration information without being assigned an IP address by sending a <code>INFORMATION-REQUEST (code 11)<\/code> message to the <code>All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers<\/code> multicast address.(Citation: rfc3315) Adversaries may use their rogue DHCP server to respond to this request message with malicious network configurations.\n\nRather than establishing an AiTM position, adversaries may also abuse DHCP spoofing to perform a DHCP exhaustion attack (i.e, [Service Exhaustion Flood](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1499\/002)) by generating many broadcast DISCOVER messages to exhaust a network\u2019s DHCP allocation pool. \nPlatforms: Linux, Windows, macOS\n\nAttack technique name: ARP Cache Poisoning\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may poison Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) caches to position themselves between the communication of two or more networked devices. This activity may be used to enable follow-on behaviors","chunk_id":"1e2396bfd3f4ef37fe1ab3735a5bc3fb","document_ids":["a728412decdea6518e95716a029e154a"],"n_tokens":1200,"entities":[{"name":"ADVERSARY-IN-THE-MIDDLE","type":"EVENT","description":"Adversary-in-the-Middle

{"id":"5e9b48f3905db7fdaccc5f73c92de51d","chunk":" attack (i.e, [Service Exhaustion Flood](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1499\/002)) by generating many broadcast DISCOVER messages to exhaust a network\u2019s DHCP allocation pool. \nPlatforms: Linux, Windows, macOS\n\nAttack technique name: ARP Cache Poisoning\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may poison Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) caches to position themselves between the communication of two or more networked devices. This activity may be used to enable follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1040) or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1565\/002).\n\nThe ARP protocol is used to resolve IPv4 addresses to link layer addresses, such as a media access control (MAC) address.(Citation: RFC826 ARP) Devices in a local network segment communicate with each other by using link layer addresses. If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address. The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address. The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.\n\nAn adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of the requesting device. The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device. For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner. Adversaries may also send a gratuitous ARP reply that maliciously announces the ownership of a particular IP address to all the devices in the local network segment.\n\nThe ARP protocol is stateless and does not require authentication. Therefore, devices may wrongly add or update the MAC address of the IP address in their ARP cache.(Citation: Sans ARP Spoofing Aug 2003)(Citation: Cylance Cleaver)\n\nAdversaries may use ARP cache poisoning as a means to intercept network traffic. This activity may be used to collect and\/or relay data such as credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol.(Citation: Sans ARP Spoofing Aug 2003)\n\nPlatforms: Linux, Windows, macOS\n\nAttack technique name: LLMNR\/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay\nAttack technique description: By responding to LLMNR\/NBT-NS network traffic, adversaries may spoof an authoritative source for name resolution to force communication with an adversary controlled system. This activity may be used to collect or relay authentication materials. \n\nLink-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) are Microsoft Windows components that serve as alternate methods of host identification. LLMNR is based upon the Domain Name System (DNS) format and allows hosts on the same local link to perform name resolution for other hosts. NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name. (Citation: Wikipedia LLMNR)(Citation: TechNet NetBIOS)\n\nAdversaries can spoof an authoritative source for name resolution on a victim network by responding to LLMNR (UDP 5355)\/NBT-NS (UDP 137) traffic as if they know the identity of the requested host, effectively poisoning the service so that the victims will communicate with the adversary controlled system. If the requested host belongs to a resource that requires identification\/authentication, the username and NTLMv2 hash will then be sent to the adversary controlled system. The adversary can then collect the hash information sent over the wire through tools that monitor the ports for traffic or through [Network Sniffing](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1040) and crack the hashes offline through [Brute Force](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1110) to obtain the plaintext passwords.\n\nIn some cases where an adversary has access to a system that is in the authentication path between systems or when automated scans that use credentials attempt to authenticate to an adversary controlled system, the NTLMv1\/v2 hashes can be intercepted and relayed to access and execute code against a target system. The relay step can happen in conjunction with poisoning but may also be independent of it.(Citation: byt3bl33d3r NTLM Relaying)(Citation: Secure Ideas SMB Relay) Additionally, adversaries may encapsulate the NTLMv1\/v2 hashes into various protocols, such as LDAP, SMB, MSSQL and HTTP, to expand and use multiple services with the valid NTLM response.\u00a0\n\nSeveral tools may be used to poison name services within local networks such as NBNSpoof, Metasploit, and [Responder](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/software\/S0174).(Citation: GitHub NBNSpoof)(Citation: Rapid7 LLMNR Spoofer)(Citation: GitHub Responder)\nPlatforms: Windows\n","chunk_id":"5e9b48f3905db7fdaccc5f73c92de51d","document_ids":["a728412decdea6518e95716a029e154a"],"n_tokens":1041,"entities":[{"name":"ARP

Their names are as follows:\n* Security Account Manager\n* LSA Secrets\n* DCSync\n* Proc Filesystem\n* NTDS\n* Cached Domain Credentials\n* LSASS Memory\n* \/etc\/passwd and \/etc\/shadow\n\nThe following content describes information about the attack techniques. The format of each attack technique's information is as follows:\nAttack technique name: ***\nAttack technique description: ***\nPlatforms: ***\nThese respectively represent the name of the attack technique, a detailed description, and the platforms it can target.\n\nAttack technique name: OS Credential Dumping\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may attempt to dump credentials to obtain account login and credential material, normally in the form of a hash or a clear text password. Credentials can be obtained from OS caches, memory, or structures.(Citation: Brining MimiKatz to Unix) Credentials can then be used to perform [Lateral Movement](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/tactics\/TA0008) and access restricted information.\n\nSeveral of the tools mentioned in associated sub-techniques may be used by both adversaries and professional security testers. Additional custom tools likely exist as well.\n\nPlatforms: Windows, Linux, macOS\n\nAttack technique name: Security Account Manager\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may attempt to extract credential material from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database either through in-memory techniques or through the Windows Registry where the SAM database is stored. The SAM is a database file that contains local accounts for the host, typically those found with the <code>net user<\/code> command. Enumerating the SAM database requires SYSTEM level access.\n\nA number of tools can be used to retrieve the SAM file through in-memory techniques:\n\n* pwdumpx.exe\n* [gsecdump](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/software\/S0008)\n* [Mimikatz](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/software\/S0002)\n* secretsdump.py\n\nAlternatively, the SAM can be extracted from the Registry with Reg:\n\n* <code>reg save HKLM\\sam sam<\/code>\n* <code>reg save HKLM\\system system<\/code>\n\nCreddump7 can then be used to process the SAM database locally to retrieve hashes.(Citation: GitHub Creddump7)\n\nNotes: \n\n* RID 500 account is the local, built-in administrator.\n* RID 501 is the guest account.\n* User accounts start with a RID of 1,000+.\n\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: LSA Secrets\nAttack technique description: Adversaries with SYSTEM access to a host may attempt to access Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets, which can contain a variety of different credential materials, such as credentials for service accounts.(Citation: Passcape LSA Secrets)(Citation: Microsoft AD Admin Tier Model)(Citation: Tilbury Windows Credentials) LSA secrets are stored in the registry at <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SECURITY\\Policy\\Secrets<\/code>. LSA secrets can also be dumped from memory.(Citation: ired Dumping LSA Secrets)\n\n[Reg](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/software\/S0075) can be used to extract from the Registry. [Mimikatz](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/software\/S0002) can be used to extract secrets from memory.(Citation: ired Dumping LSA Secrets)\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: DCSync\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may attempt to access credentials and other sensitive information by abusing a Windows Domain Controller's application programming interface (API)(Citation: Microsoft DRSR Dec 2017) (Citation: Microsoft GetNCCChanges) (Citation: Samba DRSUAPI) (Citation: Wine API samlib.dll) to simulate the replication process from a remote domain controller using a technique called DCSync.\n\nMembers of the Administrators, Domain Admins, and Enterprise Admin groups or computer accounts on the domain controller are able to run DCSync to pull password data(Citation: ADSecurity Mimikatz DCSync) from Active Directory, which may include current and historical hashes of potentially useful accounts such as KRBTGT and Administrators. The hashes can then in turn be used to create a [Golden Ticket](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1558\/001) for use in [Pass the Ticket](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1550\/003)(Citation: Harmj0y Mimikatz and DCSync) or change an account's password as noted in [Account Manipulation](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1098).(Citation: InsiderThreat ChangeNTLM July 2017)\n\nDCSync functionality has been included in the \"lsadump\" module in [Mimikatz](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/software\/S0002).(Citation: GitHub Mimikatz lsadump Module) Lsadump also includes NetSync, which performs DCSync over a legacy replication protocol.(Citation: Microsoft NRPC Dec 2017)\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Proc Filesystem\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may gather credentials from the proc filesystem or `\/proc`. The proc filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem used as an interface to kernel data structures for Linux based systems managing virtual memory. For each process, the `\/proc\/<PID>\/maps` file shows how memory is mapped within the process\u2019s virtual address space. And `\/proc\/<PID>\/mem`, exposed for debugging purposes, provides access to the process\u2019s virtual address space.(Citation: Picus Labs Proc cump 2022)(Citation: baeldung Linux proc map

Some services or programs may save credentials in clear text inside the process\u2019s memory.(Citation: MimiPenguin GitHub May 2017)(Citation: Polop Linux PrivEsc Gitbook)\n\nIf running as or with the permissions of a web browser, a process can search the `\/maps` & `\/mem` locations for common website credential patterns (that can also be used to find adjacent memory within the same structure) in which hashes or cleartext credentials may be located.\nPlatforms: Linux\n\nAttack technique name: NTDS\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may attempt to access or create a copy of the Active Directory domain database in order to steal credential information, as well as obtain other information about domain members such as devices, users, and access rights. By default, the NTDS file (NTDS.dit) is located in <code>%SystemRoot%\\NTDS\\Ntds.dit<\/code> of a domain controller.(Citation: Wikipedia Active Directory)\n\nIn addition to looking for NTDS files on active Domain Controllers, adversaries may search for backups that contain the same or similar information.(Citation: Metcalf 2015)\n\nThe following tools and techniques can be used to enumerate the NTDS file and the contents of the entire Active Directory hashes.\n\n* Volume Shadow Copy\n* secretsdump.py\n* Using the in-built Windows tool, ntdsutil.exe\n* Invoke-NinjaCopy\n\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Cached Domain Credentials\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may attempt to access cached domain credentials used to allow authentication to occur in the event a domain controller is unavailable.(Citation: Microsoft - Cached Creds)\n\nOn Windows Vista and newer, the hash format is DCC2 (Domain Cached Credentials version 2) hash, also known as MS-Cache v2 hash.(Citation: PassLib mscache) The number of default cached credentials varies and can be altered per system. This hash does not allow pass-the-hash style attacks, and instead requires [Password Cracking](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1110\/002) to recover the plaintext password.(Citation: ired mscache)\n\nOn Linux systems, Active Directory credentials can be accessed through caches maintained by software like System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) or Quest Authentication Services (formerly VAS). Cached credential hashes are typically located at `\/var\/lib\/sss\/db\/cache.[domain].ldb` for SSSD or `\/var\/opt\/quest\/vas\/authcache\/vas_auth.vdb` for Quest. Adversaries can use utilities, such as `tdbdump`, on these database files to dump the cached hashes and use [Password Cracking](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1110\/002) to obtain the plaintext password.(Citation: Brining MimiKatz to Unix) \n\nWith SYSTEM or sudo access, the tools\/utilities such as [Mimikatz](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/software\/S0002), [Reg](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/software\/S0075), and secretsdump.py for Windows or Linikatz for Linux can be used to extract the cached credentials.(Citation: Brining MimiKatz to Unix)\n\nNote: Cached credentials for Windows Vista are derived using PBKDF2.(Citation: PassLib mscache)\nPlatforms: Windows, Linux\n\nAttack technique name: LSASS Memory\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may attempt to access credential material stored in the process memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS). After a user logs on, the system generates and stores a variety of credential materials in LSASS process memory. These credential materials can be harvested by an administrative user or SYSTEM and used to conduct [Lateral Movement](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/tactics\/TA0008) using [Use Alternate Authentication Material](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1550).\n\nAs well as in-memory techniques, the LSASS process memory can be dumped from the target host and analyzed on a local system.\n\nFor example, on the target host use procdump:\n\n* <code>procdump -ma lsass.exe lsass_dump<\/code>\n\nLocally, mimikatz can be run using:\n\n* <code>sekurlsa::Minidump lsassdump.dmp<\/code>\n* <code>sekurlsa::logonPasswords<\/code>\n\nBuilt-in Windows tools such as `comsvcs.dll` can also be used:\n\n* <code>rundll32.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\comsvcs.dll MiniDump PID  lsass.dmp

Configuration repositories are used by management systems in order to configure, manage, and control data on remote systems. Configuration repositories may also facilitate remote access and administration of devices.\n\nAdversaries may target these repositories in order to collect large quantities of sensitive system administration data. Data from configuration repositories may be exposed by various protocols and software and can store a wide variety of data, much of which may align with adversary Discovery objectives.(Citation: US-CERT-TA18-106A)(Citation: US-CERT TA17-156A SNMP Abuse 2017)\nPlatforms: Network\n\nAttack technique name: Network Device Configuration Dump\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may access network configuration files to collect sensitive data about the device and the network. The network configuration is a file containing parameters that determine the operation of the device. The device typically stores an in-memory copy of the configuration while operating, and a separate configuration on non-volatile storage to load after device reset. Adversaries can inspect the configuration files to reveal information about the target network and its layout, the network device and its software, or identifying legitimate accounts and credentials for later use.\n\nAdversaries can use common management tools and protocols, such as Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and Smart Install (SMI), to access network configuration files.(Citation: US-CERT TA18-106A Network Infrastructure Devices 2018)(Citation: Cisco Blog Legacy Device Attacks) These tools may be used to query specific data from a configuration repository or configure the device to export the configuration for later analysis. \nPlatforms: Network\n\nAttack technique name: SNMP (MIB Dump)\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may target the Management Information Base (MIB) to collect and\/or mine valuable information in a network managed using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).\n\nThe MIB is a configuration repository that stores variable information accessible via SNMP in the form of object identifiers (OID). Each OID identifies a variable that can be read or set and permits active management tasks, such as configuration changes, through remote modification of these variables. SNMP can give administrators great insight in their systems, such as, system information, description of hardware, physical location, and software packages(Citation: SANS Information Security Reading Room Securing SNMP Securing SNMP). The MIB may also contain device operational information, including running configuration, routing table, and interface details.\n\nAdversaries may use SNMP queries to collect MIB content directly from

With direct write access to a disk, adversaries may attempt to overwrite portions of disk data. Adversaries may opt to wipe arbitrary portions of disk data and\/or wipe disk structures like the master boot record (MBR). A complete wipe of all disk sectors may be attempted.\n\nTo maximize impact on the target organization in operations where network-wide availability interruption is the goal, malware used for wiping disks may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging additional techniques like [Valid Accounts](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1078), [OS Credential Dumping](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1003), and [SMB\/Windows Admin Shares](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1021\/002).(Citation: Novetta Blockbuster Destructive Malware)\n\nOn network devices, adversaries may wipe configuration files and other data from the device using [Network Device CLI](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1059\/008) commands such as `erase`.(Citation: erase_cmd_cisco)\nPlatforms: Linux, macOS, Windows, Network\n\nAttack technique name: Disk Structure Wipe\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may corrupt or wipe the disk data structures on a hard drive necessary to boot a system; targeting specific critical systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources. \n\nAdversaries may attempt to render the system unable to boot by overwriting critical data located in structures such as the master boot record (MBR) or partition table.(Citation: Symantec Shamoon 2012)(Citation: FireEye Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Palo Alto Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Kaspersky StoneDrill 2017)(Citation: Unit 42 Shamoon3 2018) The data contained in disk structures may include the initial executable code for loading an operating system or the location of the file system partitions on disk. If this information is not present, the computer will not be able to load an operating system during the boot process, leaving the computer unavailable. [Disk Structure Wipe](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1561\/002) may be performed in isolation, or along with [Disk Content Wipe](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1561\/001) if all sectors of a disk are wiped.\n\nOn a network devices, adversaries may reformat the file system using [Network Device CLI](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1059\/008) commands such as `format`.(Citation: format_cmd_cisco)\n\nTo maximize impact on the target organization, malware designed for destroying disk structures may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging other techniques like [Valid Accounts](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1078), [OS Credential Dumping](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1003), and [SMB\/Windows Admin Shares](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1021\/002).(Citation: Symantec Shamoon 2012)(Citation: FireEye Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Palo Alto Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Kaspersky StoneDrill 2017)\nPlatforms: Linux, macOS, Windows, Network\n\nAttack technique name: Disk Content Wipe\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may erase the contents of storage devices on specific systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources.\n\nAdversaries may partially or completely overwrite the contents of a storage device rendering the data irrecoverable through the storage interface.(Citation: Novetta Blockbuster)(Citation: Novetta Blockbuster Destructive Malware)(Citation: DOJ Lazarus Sony 2018) Instead of wiping specific disk structures or files, adversaries with destructive intent may wipe arbitrary portions of disk content. To wipe disk content, adversaries may acquire direct access to the hard drive in order to overwrite arbitrarily sized portions of disk with random data.(Citation: Novetta Blockbuster Destructive Malware) Adversaries have also been observed leveraging third-party drivers like [RawDisk](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/software\/S0364) to directly access disk content.(Citation: Novetta Blockbuster)(Citation: Novetta Blockbuster Destructive Malware) This behavior is distinct from [Data Destruction](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1485) because sections of the disk are erased

Operating systems may have features to hide various artifacts, such as important system files and administrative task execution, to avoid disrupting user work environments and prevent users from changing files or features on the system. Adversaries may abuse these features to hide artifacts such as files, directories, user accounts, or other system activity to evade detection.(Citation: Sofacy Komplex Trojan)(Citation: Cybereason OSX Pirrit)(Citation: MalwareBytes ADS July 2015)\n\nAdversaries may also attempt to hide artifacts associated with malicious behavior by creating computing regions that are isolated from common security instrumentation, such as through the use of virtualization technology.(Citation: Sophos Ragnar May 2020)\nPlatforms: Linux, macOS, Windows, Office 365\n\nAttack technique name: Hidden Window\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may use hidden windows to conceal malicious activity from the plain sight of users. In some cases, windows that would typically be displayed when an application carries out an operation can be hidden. This may be utilized by system administrators to avoid disrupting user work environments when carrying out administrative tasks. \n\nAdversaries may abuse these functionalities to hide otherwise visible windows from users so as not to alert the user to adversary activity on the system.(Citation: Antiquated Mac Malware)\n\nOn macOS, the configurations for how applications run are listed in property list (plist) files. One of the tags in these files can be <code>apple.awt.UIElement<\/code>, which allows for Java applications to prevent the application's icon from appearing in the Dock. A common use for this is when applications run in the system tray, but don't also want to show up in the Dock.\n\nSimilarly, on Windows there are a variety of features in scripting languages, such as [PowerShell](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1059\/001), Jscript, and [Visual Basic](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1059\/005) to make windows hidden. One example of this is <code>powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden<\/code>.(Citation: PowerShell About 2019)\n\nIn addition, Windows supports the `CreateDesktop()` API that can create a hidden desktop window with its own corresponding <code>explorer.exe<\/code> process.(Citation: Hidden VNC)(Citation: Anatomy of an hVNC Attack)  All applications running on the hidden desktop window, such as a hidden VNC (hVNC) session,(Citation: Hidden VNC) will be invisible to other desktops windows.\nPlatforms: macOS, Windows, Linux\n\nAttack technique name: Ignore Process Interrupts\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may evade defensive mechanisms by executing commands that hide from process interrupt signals. Many operating systems use signals to deliver messages to control process behavior. Command interpreters often include specific commands\/flags that ignore errors and other hangups, such as when the user of the active session logs off.(Citation: Linux Signal Man)  These interrupt signals may also be used by defensive tools and\/or analysts to pause or terminate specified running processes. \n\nAdversaries may invoke processes using `nohup`, [PowerShell](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1059\/001) `-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`, or similar commands that may be immune to hangups.(Citation: nohup Linux Man)(Citation: Microsoft PowerShell SilentlyContinue) This may enable malicious commands and malware to continue execution through system events that would otherwise terminate its execution, such as users logging off or the termination of its C2 network connection.\n\nHiding from process interrupt signals may allow malware to continue execution, but unlike [Trap](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1546\/005) this does not establish [Persistence](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/tactics\/TA0003) since the process will not be re-invoked once actually terminated.\nPlatforms: Linux, macOS, Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Hidden Users\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may use hidden users to hide the presence of user accounts they create or modify. Administrators may want to hide users when there are many user accounts on a given system or if they want to hide their administrative or other management accounts from other users. \n\nIn macOS, adversaries can create or modify a user to be hidden through manipulating plist files, folder attributes, and user attributes. To prevent a user from being shown on the login screen and in System Preferences, adversaries can set the userID to be under 500 and set the key value <code>Hide500Users<\/code> to <code>TRUE<\/code> in the <code>\/Library\/Preferences\/com.apple.loginwindow<\/code> plist file.(Citation: Cybereason OSX Pirrit) Every user has a userID associated with it. When the <code>Hide500Users<\/code> key value is set to <code>TRUE<\/code>, users with a userID under 500 do not appear on the login screen and in System Preferences","chunk_id":"2048d8dffb051d847f6dcda5f9d5d6c0","document_ids":["e815b57103448f31ab13adbf59adf5ac"],"n_tokens":1200,"entities":[{"name":"HIDE ARTIFACTS","type":"EVENT","description":"Hide

When the <code>Hide500Users<\/code> key value is set to <code>TRUE<\/code>, users with a userID under 500 do not appear on the login screen and in System Preferences. Using the command line, adversaries can use the <code>dscl<\/code> utility to create hidden user accounts by setting the <code>IsHidden<\/code> attribute to <code>1<\/code>. Adversaries can also hide a user\u2019s home folder by changing the <code>chflags<\/code> to hidden.(Citation: Apple Support Hide a User Account) \n\nAdversaries may similarly hide user accounts in Windows. Adversaries can set the <code>HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\SpecialAccounts\\UserList<\/code> Registry key value to <code>0<\/code> for a specific user to prevent that user from being listed on the logon screen.(Citation: FireEye SMOKEDHAM June 2021)(Citation: US-CERT TA18-074A)\n\nOn Linux systems, adversaries may hide user accounts from the login screen, also referred to as the greeter. The method an adversary may use depends on which Display Manager the distribution is currently using. For example, on an Ubuntu system using the GNOME Display Manger (GDM), accounts may be hidden from the greeter using the <code>gsettings<\/code> command (ex: <code>sudo -u gdm gsettings set org.gnome.login-screen disable-user-list true<\/code>).(Citation: Hide GDM User Accounts) Display Managers are not anchored to specific distributions and may be changed by a user or adversary.\nPlatforms: macOS, Windows, Linux\n\nAttack technique name: File\/Path Exclusions\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may attempt to hide their file-based artifacts by writing them to specific folders or file names excluded from antivirus (AV) scanning and other defensive capabilities. AV and other file-based scanners often include exclusions to optimize performance as well as ease installation and legitimate use of applications. These exclusions may be contextual (e.g., scans are only initiated in response to specific triggering events\/alerts), but are also often hardcoded strings referencing specific folders and\/or files assumed to be trusted and legitimate.(Citation: Microsoft File Folder Exclusions)\n\nAdversaries may abuse these exclusions to hide their file-based artifacts. For example, rather than  tampering with tool settings to add a new exclusion (i.e., [Disable or Modify Tools](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1562\/001)), adversaries may drop their file-based payloads in default or otherwise well-known exclusions. Adversaries may also use [Security Software Discovery](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1518\/001) and other [Discovery](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/tactics\/TA0007)\/[Reconnaissance](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/tactics\/TA0043) activities to both discover and verify existing exclusions in a victim environment.\nPlatforms: Linux, macOS, Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Email Hiding Rules\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may use email rules to hide inbound emails in a compromised user's mailbox. Many email clients allow users to create inbox rules for various email functions, including moving emails to other folders, marking emails as read, or deleting emails. Rules may be created or modified within email clients or through external features such as the <code>New-InboxRule<\/code> or <code>Set-InboxRule<\/code> [PowerShell](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1059\/001) cmdlets on Windows systems.(Citation: Microsoft Inbox Rules)(Citation: MacOS Email Rules)(Citation: Microsoft New-InboxRule)(Citation: Microsoft Set-InboxRule)\n\nAdversaries may utilize email rules within a compromised user's mailbox to delete and\/or move emails to less noticeable folders. Adversaries may do this to hide security alerts, C2 communication, or responses to [Internal Spearphishing](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1534) emails sent from the compromised account.\n\nAny user or administrator within the organization (or adversary with valid credentials) may be able to create rules to automatically move or delete emails. These rules can be abused to impair\/delay detection had the email content been immediately seen by a user or defender. Malicious rules commonly filter out emails based on key words (such as <code>malware<\/code>, <code>suspicious<\/code>, <code>phish<\/code>, and <code>hack<\/code>) found in message bodies and subject lines. (Citation: Microsoft Cloud App Security)\n\nIn some environments, administrators may be able to enable email rules that operate organization-wide rather than on individual inboxes. For example, Microsoft Exchange supports transport rules that evaluate all mail an organization receives against user-specified conditions, then performs a user-specified action on mail that adheres to those conditions.(Citation: Microsoft Mail Flow Rules 2023) Adversaries that abuse such features may be able to automatically modify or delete all emails related to specific topics (such as internal security incident notifications).\nPlatforms: Windows, Office 365, Linux, macOS, Google Workspace\n\nAttack technique name: Resource Forking\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may abuse resource forks to hide malicious code or executables to evade detection and bypass security applications.

A resource fork provides applications a structured way to store resources such as thumbnail images, menu definitions, icons, dialog boxes, and code.(Citation: macOS Hierarchical File System Overview) Usage of a resource fork is identifiable when displaying a file\u2019s extended attributes, using <code>ls -l@<\/code> or <code>xattr -l<\/code> commands. Resource forks have been deprecated and replaced with the application bundle structure. Non-localized resources are placed at the top level directory of an application bundle, while localized resources are placed in the <code>\/Resources<\/code> folder.(Citation: Resource and Data Forks)(Citation: ELC Extended Attributes)\n\nAdversaries can use resource forks to hide malicious data that may otherwise be stored directly in files. Adversaries can execute content with an attached resource fork, at a specified offset, that is moved to an executable location then invoked. Resource fork content may also be obfuscated\/encrypted until execution.(Citation: sentinellabs resource named fork 2020)(Citation: tau bundlore erika noerenberg 2020)\nPlatforms: macOS\n\nAttack technique name: Run Virtual Instance\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may carry out malicious operations using a virtual instance to avoid detection. A wide variety of virtualization technologies exist that allow for the emulation of a computer or computing environment. By running malicious code inside of a virtual instance, adversaries can hide artifacts associated with their behavior from security tools that are unable to monitor activity inside the virtual instance. Additionally, depending on the virtual networking implementation (ex: bridged adapter), network traffic generated by the virtual instance can be difficult to trace back to the compromised host as the IP address and hostname might not match known values.(Citation: SingHealth Breach Jan 2019)\n\nAdversaries may utilize native support for virtualization (ex: Hyper-V) or drop the necessary files to run a virtual instance (ex: VirtualBox binaries). After running a virtual instance, adversaries may create a shared folder between the guest and host with permissions that enable the virtual instance to interact with the host file system.(Citation: Sophos Ragnar May 2020)\nPlatforms: Linux, macOS, Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Process Argument Spoofing\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may attempt to hide process command-line arguments by overwriting process memory. Process command-line arguments are stored in the process environment block (PEB), a data structure used by Windows to store various information about\/used by a process. The PEB includes the process command-line arguments that are referenced when executing the process. When a process is created, defensive tools\/sensors that monitor process creations may retrieve the process arguments from the PEB.(Citation: Microsoft PEB 2021)(Citation: Xpn Argue Like Cobalt 2019)\n\nAdversaries may manipulate a process PEB to evade defenses. For example, [Process Hollowing](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1055\/012) can be abused to spawn a process in a suspended state with benign arguments. After the process is spawned and the PEB is initialized (and process information is potentially logged by tools\/sensors), adversaries may override the PEB to modify the command-line arguments (ex: using the [Native API](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1106) <code>WriteProcessMemory()<\/code> function) then resume process execution with malicious arguments.(Citation: Cobalt Strike Arguments 2019)(Citation: Xpn Argue Like Cobalt 2019)(Citation: Nviso Spoof Command Line 2020)\n\nAdversaries may also execute a process with malicious command-line arguments then patch the memory with benign arguments that may bypass subsequent process memory analysis.(Citation: FireEye FiveHands April 2021)\n\nThis behavior may also be combined with other tricks (such as [Parent PID Spoofing](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1134\/004)) to manipulate or further evade process-based detections.\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Hidden Files and Directories\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may set files and directories to be hidden to evade detection mechanisms. To prevent normal users from accidentally changing special files on a system, most operating systems have the concept of a \u2018hidden\u2019 file. These files don\u2019t show up when a user browses the file system with a GUI or when using normal commands on the command line. Users must explicitly ask to show the hidden files either via a series of Graphical User Interface (GUI) prompts or with command line switches (<code>dir \/a<\/code> for Windows and <code>ls \u2013a<\/code> for Linux and macOS).\n\nOn Linux and Mac, users can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a \u201c.\u201d as the first character in the file or folder name  (Citation: Sofacy Komplex Trojan) (Citation: Antiquated Mac Malware). Files and folders that start with a period, \u2018.\u2019, are by default hidden from being viewed in the Finder application and standard command-line utilities like \u201cls\u201d. Users must specifically change settings to have these files viewable.\n\nFiles on macOS can also be marked with the UF_HIDDEN flag which prevents them from being seen in Finder.app, but still allows them to be seen in Terminal.app (Citation: WireLurker). On Windows, users can mark specific files as hidden by using the attrib.exe binary. Many applications create these hidden files","chunk_id":"7730678e53e163f396f171f84a0366e3","document_ids":["e815b57103448f31ab13adbf59adf5ac"],"n_tokens":1200,"entities":[{"name":"WINDOWS","type":"ORGANIZATION","description":"Windows is

{"id":"4bffa144c82696232a96c173845a1218","chunk":", \u2018.\u2019, are by default hidden from being viewed in the Finder application and standard command-line utilities like \u201cls\u201d. Users must specifically change settings to have these files viewable.\n\nFiles on macOS can also be marked with the UF_HIDDEN flag which prevents them from being seen in Finder.app, but still allows them to be seen in Terminal.app (Citation: WireLurker). On Windows, users can mark specific files as hidden by using the attrib.exe binary. Many applications create these hidden files and folders to store information so that it doesn\u2019t clutter up the user\u2019s workspace. For example, SSH utilities create a .ssh folder that\u2019s hidden and contains the user\u2019s known hosts and keys.\n\nAdversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files and folders anywhere on the system and evading a typical user or system analysis that does not incorporate investigation of hidden files.\nPlatforms: Windows, macOS, Linux\n\nAttack technique name: NTFS File Attributes\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may use NTFS file attributes to hide their malicious data in order to evade detection. Every New Technology File System (NTFS) formatted partition contains a Master File Table (MFT) that maintains a record for every file\/directory on the partition. (Citation: SpectorOps Host-Based Jul 2017) Within MFT entries are file attributes, (Citation: Microsoft NTFS File Attributes Aug 2010) such as Extended Attributes (EA) and Data [known as Alternate Data Streams (ADSs) when more than one Data attribute is present], that can be used to store arbitrary data (and even complete files). (Citation: SpectorOps Host-Based Jul 2017) (Citation: Microsoft File Streams) (Citation: MalwareBytes ADS July 2015) (Citation: Microsoft ADS Mar 2014)\n\nAdversaries may store malicious data or binaries in file attribute metadata instead of directly in files. This may be done to evade some defenses, such as static indicator scanning tools and anti-virus. (Citation: Journey into IR ZeroAccess NTFS EA) (Citation: MalwareBytes ADS July 2015)\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: VBA Stomping\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may hide malicious Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) payloads embedded within MS Office documents by replacing the VBA source code with benign data.(Citation: FireEye VBA stomp Feb 2020)\n\nMS Office documents with embedded VBA content store source code inside of module streams. Each module stream has a <code>PerformanceCache<\/code> that stores a separate compiled version of the VBA source code known as p-code. The p-code is executed when the MS Office version specified in the <code>_VBA_PROJECT<\/code> stream (which contains the version-dependent description of the VBA project) matches the version of the host MS Office application.(Citation: Evil Clippy May 2019)(Citation: Microsoft _VBA_PROJECT Stream)\n\nAn adversary may hide malicious VBA code by overwriting the VBA source code location with zero\u2019s, benign code, or random bytes while leaving the previously compiled malicious p-code. Tools that scan for malicious VBA source code may be bypassed as the unwanted code is hidden in the compiled p-code. If the VBA source code is removed, some tools might even think that there are no macros present. If there is a version match between the <code>_VBA_PROJECT<\/code> stream and host MS Office application, the p-code will be executed, otherwise the benign VBA source code will be decompressed and recompiled to p-code, thus removing malicious p-code and potentially bypassing dynamic analysis.(Citation: Walmart Roberts Oct 2018)(Citation: FireEye VBA stomp Feb 2020)(Citation: pcodedmp Bontchev)\nPlatforms: Linux, Windows, macOS\n\nAttack technique name: Hidden File System\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may use a hidden file system to conceal malicious activity from users and security tools. File systems provide a structure to store and access data from physical storage. Typically, a user engages with a file system through applications that allow them to access files and directories, which are an abstraction from their physical location (ex: disk sector). Standard file systems include FAT, NTFS, ext4, and APFS. File systems can also contain other structures, such as the Volume Boot Record (VBR) and Master File Table (MFT) in NTFS.(Citation: MalwareTech VFS Nov 2014)\n\nAdversaries may use their own abstracted file system, separate from the standard file system present on the infected system. In doing so, adversaries can hide the presence of malicious components and file input\/output from security tools. Hidden file systems, sometimes referred to as virtual file systems, can be implemented in numerous ways. One implementation would be to store a file system in reserved disk space unused by disk structures or standard file system partitions.(Citation: MalwareTech VFS Nov 2014)(Citation: FireEye Bootkits) Another implementation could be for an adversary to drop their own portable partition image as a file on top of the standard file system.(Citation: ESET ComRAT May 2020) Adversaries may also fragment files across the existing file system structure in non-standard ways.(Citation: Kaspersky Equation QA)\nPlatforms: Linux, macOS,

{"id":"6e77dae88408089386eb4fb3c9f573c4","chunk":"There are 8 sub attack techniques of the attack technique called Acquire Infrastructure. Their names are as follows:\n* Malvertising\n* Domains\n* Botnet\n* Server\n* DNS Server\n* Virtual Private Server\n* Serverless\n* Web Services\n\nThe following content describes information about the attack techniques. The format of each attack technique's information is as follows:\nAttack technique name: ***\nAttack technique description: ***\nPlatforms: ***\nThese respectively represent the name of the attack technique, a detailed description, and the platforms it can target.\n\nAttack technique name: Acquire Infrastructure\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may buy, lease, rent, or obtain infrastructure that can be used during targeting. A wide variety of infrastructure exists for hosting and orchestrating adversary operations. Infrastructure solutions include physical or cloud servers, domains, and third-party web services.(Citation: TrendmicroHideoutsLease) Some infrastructure providers offer free trial periods, enabling infrastructure acquisition at limited to no cost.(Citation: Free Trial PurpleUrchin) Additionally, botnets are available for rent or purchase.\n\nUse of these infrastructure solutions allows adversaries to stage, launch, and execute operations. Solutions may help adversary operations blend in with traffic that is seen as normal, such as contacting third-party web services or acquiring infrastructure to support [Proxy](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1090), including from residential proxy services.(Citation: amnesty_nso_pegasus)(Citation: FBI Proxies Credential Stuffing)(Citation: Mandiant APT29 Microsoft 365 2022) Depending on the implementation, adversaries may use infrastructure that makes it difficult to physically tie back to them as well as utilize infrastructure that can be rapidly provisioned, modified, and shut down.\nPlatforms: PRE\n\nAttack technique name: Malvertising\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may purchase online advertisements that can be abused to distribute malware to victims. Ads can be purchased to plant as well as favorably position artifacts in specific locations  online, such as prominently placed within search engine results. These ads may make it more difficult for users to distinguish between actual search results and advertisements.(Citation: spamhaus-malvertising) Purchased ads may also target specific audiences using the advertising network\u2019s capabilities, potentially further taking advantage of the trust inherently given to search engines and popular websites. \n\nAdversaries may purchase ads and other resources to help distribute artifacts containing malicious code to victims. Purchased ads may attempt to impersonate or spoof well-known brands. For example, these spoofed ads may trick victims into clicking the ad which could then send them to a malicious domain that may be a clone of official websites containing trojanized versions of the advertised software.(Citation: Masquerads-Guardio)(Citation: FBI-search) Adversary\u2019s efforts to create malicious domains and purchase advertisements may also be automated at scale to better resist cleanup efforts.(Citation: sentinelone-malvertising) \n\nMalvertising may be used to support [Drive-by Target](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1608\/004) and [Drive-by Compromise](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1189), potentially requiring limited interaction from the user if the ad contains code\/exploits that infect the target system's web browser.(Citation: BBC-malvertising)\n\nAdversaries may also employ several techniques to evade detection by the advertising network. For example, adversaries may dynamically route ad clicks to send automated crawler\/policy enforcer traffic to benign sites while validating potential targets then sending victims referred from real ad clicks to malicious pages. This infection vector may therefore remain hidden from the ad network as well as any visitor not reaching the malicious sites with a valid identifier from clicking on the advertisement.(Citation: Masquerads-Guardio) Other tricks, such as intentional typos to avoid brand reputation monitoring, may also be used to evade automated detection.(Citation: spamhaus-malvertising) \nPlatforms: PRE\n\nAttack technique name: Domains\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may acquire domains that can be used during targeting. Domain names are the human readable names used to represent one or more IP addresses. They can be purchased or, in some cases, acquired for free.\n\nAdversaries may use acquired domains for a variety of purposes, including for [Phishing](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1566), [Drive-by Compromise](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1189), and Command and Control.(Citation: CISA MSS Sep 2020) Adversaries may choose domains that are similar to legitimate domains, including through use of homoglyphs or use of a different top-level domain (TLD).(Citation: FireEye APT28)(Citation: PaypalScam) Typosquatting may be used to aid in delivery of payloads via [Drive-by Compromise](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1189). Adversaries may also use internationalized domain names (IDNs) and different character sets (e.g. Cyrillic, Greek, etc.) to execute \"IDN homograph attacks,\" creating visually similar lookalike domains used to deliver malware to victim machines.(Citation: CISA IDN ST05-016)(Citation: tt_httrack_fake_domains)(Citation: tt_obliqueRAT)(Citation: httrack_unhcr)(Citation: lazgroup_idn_phishing)\n\nDifferent URIs\/URLs may also be dynamically generated to uniquely serve malicious content to victims (including one-time, single use domain names).(Citation: iOS URL Scheme)(Citation: URI)(Citation: URI Use)(Citation: URI Unique)\n\nAdversaries may also acquire and repurpose expired domains, which may be potentially already allowlisted\/trusted by defenders based on an existing reputation\/history.(Citation","chunk_id":"6e77dae88408089386eb4fb3c9f573c4","document_ids":["ecbc0026949b630ae2d15627f499dd85"],"n_tokens":1200,"entities":[{"name":"ACQUIRE

Free trial periods of cloud servers may also be abused.(Citation: Free Trial PurpleUrchin)(Citation: Freejacked) \n\nAdversaries may only need a lightweight setup if most of their activities will take place using online infrastructure. Or, they may need to build extensive infrastructure if they want to test, communicate, and control other aspects of their activities on their own systems.(Citation: NYTStuxnet)\nPlatforms: PRE\n\nAttack technique name: DNS Server\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may set up their own Domain Name System (DNS) servers that can be used during targeting. During post-compromise activity, adversaries may utilize DNS traffic for various tasks, including for Command and Control (ex: [Application Layer Protocol](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1071)). Instead of hijacking existing DNS servers, adversaries may opt to configure and run their own DNS servers in support of operations.\n\nBy running their own DNS servers, adversaries can have more control over how they administer server-side DNS C2 traffic ([DNS](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1071\/004)). With control over a DNS server, adversaries can configure DNS applications to provide conditional responses to malware and, generally, have more flexibility in the structure of the DNS-based C2 channel.(Citation: Unit42 DNS Mar 2019)\nPlatforms: PRE\n\nAttack technique name: Virtual Private Server\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may rent Virtual Private Servers (VPSs)\u00a0that can be used during targeting. There exist a variety of cloud service providers that will sell virtual machines\/containers as a service. By utilizing a VPS, adversaries can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to them. The use of cloud infrastructure can also make it easier for adversaries to rapidly provision, modify, and shut down their infrastructure.\n\nAcquiring a VPS for use in later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as Command and Control, can allow adversaries to benefit from the ubiquity and trust associated with higher reputation cloud service providers. Adversaries may also acquire infrastructure from VPS service providers that are known for renting VPSs with minimal registration information, allowing for more anonymous acquisitions of infrastructure.(Citation: TrendmicroHideoutsLease)\nPlatforms: PRE\n\nAttack technique name: Serverless\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may purchase and configure serverless cloud infrastructure, such as Cloudflare Workers or AWS Lambda functions, that can be used during targeting. By utilizing serverless infrastructure, adversaries can make it more difficult to attribute infrastructure used during operations back to them.\n\nOnce acquired, the serverless runtime environment can be leveraged to either respond directly to infected machines or to [Proxy](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1090) traffic to an adversary-owned command and control server.(Citation: BlackWater Malware Cloudflare Workers)(Citation: AWS Lambda Redirector) As traffic generated by these functions will appear to come from subdomains of common cloud providers,

Their names are as follows:\n* Reduce Key Space\n* Disable Crypto Hardware\n\nThe following content describes information about the attack techniques. The format of each attack technique's information is as follows:\nAttack technique name: ***\nAttack technique description: ***\nPlatforms: ***\nThese respectively represent the name of the attack technique, a detailed description, and the platforms it can target.\n\nAttack technique name: Weaken Encryption\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may compromise a network device\u2019s encryption capability in order to bypass encryption that would otherwise protect data communications. (Citation: Cisco Synful Knock Evolution)\n\nEncryption can be used to protect transmitted network traffic to maintain its confidentiality (protect against unauthorized disclosure) and integrity (protect against unauthorized changes). Encryption ciphers are used to convert a plaintext message to ciphertext and can be computationally intensive to decipher without the associated decryption key. Typically, longer keys increase the cost of cryptanalysis, or decryption without the key.\n\nAdversaries can compromise and manipulate devices that perform encryption of network traffic. For example, through behaviors such as [Modify System Image](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1601), [Reduce Key Space](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1600\/001), and [Disable Crypto Hardware](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1600\/002), an adversary can negatively effect and\/or eliminate a device\u2019s ability to securely encrypt network traffic. This poses a greater risk of unauthorized disclosure and may help facilitate data manipulation, Credential Access, or Collection efforts. (Citation: Cisco Blog Legacy Device Attacks)\nPlatforms: Network\n\nAttack technique name: Reduce Key Space\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may reduce the level of effort required to decrypt data transmitted over the network by reducing the cipher strength of encrypted communications.(Citation: Cisco Synful Knock Evolution)\n\nAdversaries can weaken the encryption software on a compromised network device by reducing the key size used by the software to convert plaintext to ciphertext (e.g., from hundreds or thousands of bytes to just a couple of bytes). As a result, adversaries dramatically reduce the amount of effort needed to decrypt the protected information without the key.\n\nAdversaries may modify the key size used and other encryption parameters using specialized commands in a [Network Device CLI](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1059\/008) introduced to the system through [Modify System Image](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1601) to change the configuration of the device. (Citation: Cisco Blog Legacy Device Attacks)\nPlatforms: Network\n\nAttack technique name: Disable Crypto Hardware\nAttack technique description: Adversaries disable a network device\u2019s dedicated hardware encryption, which may enable them to leverage weaknesses in software encryption in order to reduce the effort involved in collecting, manipulating, and exfiltrating transmitted data.\n\nMany network devices such as routers, switches, and firewalls, perform encryption on network traffic to secure transmission across networks. Often, these devices are equipped with special, dedicated encryption hardware to greatly increase the speed of the encryption process as well as to prevent malicious tampering. When an adversary takes control of such a device, they may disable the dedicated hardware, for example, through use of [Modify System Image](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1601), forcing the use of software to perform encryption on general processors. This is typically used in conjunction with attacks to weaken the strength of the cipher in software (e.g., [Reduce Key Space](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1600\/001)).
