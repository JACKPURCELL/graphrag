Version 2.1 has several security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by local users. One significant issue is that it follows symbolic links when updating an NIS database, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files. Additionally, AdminSuite 2.1 incorrectly sets write permissions on source files for NIS maps, potentially enabling local users to gain elevated privileges by modifying critical files such as /etc/passwd. \n\nFurthermore, the software uses unsafe permissions when adding new users to the NIS+ password table, which can allow local users to gain root access by altering their password table entries. Another vulnerability exists in the Database Manager, which runs with setgid bin privileges, permitting local users to gain privileges through the save option. Lastly, both versions 2.1 and 2.2 create lock files insecurely, further allowing local users to obtain root privileges. Overall, these vulnerabilities highlight significant security risks associated with Solaris Solstice AdminSuite, particularly in version 2.1.\",9\n2954,NIS DATABASE,,1\n2996,NIS MAPS,NIS maps are a set of files used in the Network Information Service that can be affected by the vulnerability in Solaris Solstice AdminSuite.,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n1438,MITRE,CVE-1999-1427,MITRE assigned the CVE identifier CVE-1999-1427 for the vulnerability in Solaris Solstice AdminSuite,1817\n1660,MITRE,CVE-1999-1428,MITRE assigned the CVE identifier CVE-1999-1428,1817\n1604,MITRE,CVE-1999-1424,MITRE assigned the CVE identifier CVE-1999-1424 for the vulnerability in Solaris Solstice AdminSuite.,1816\n1195,MITRE,CVE-1999-1425,MITRE is the organization that assigned the CVE identifier CVE-1999-1425,1816\n1179,MITRE,CVE-1999-1426,MITRE assigned the CVE identifier CVE-1999-1426,1816\n4071,CVE PROGRAM CONTAINER,CVE-1999-1427,CVE Program Container manages the information related to CVE-1999-1427,777\n4164,CVE PROGRAM CONTAINER,CVE-1999-1428,CVE-1999-1428 is part of the CVE Program Container for managing vulnerabilities,777\n3952,CVE PROGRAM CONTAINER,CVE-1999-1426,CVE Program Container includes references to CVE-1999-1426,776\n5689,SECURITY FOCUS,CVE-1999-1428,\"Security Focus provides a reference link for CVE-1999-1428, detailing the vulnerability\",363\n5676,SECURITY FOCUS,CVE-1999-1424,\"Security Focus provides references for CVE-1999-1424, indicating its relevance in the context of security vulnerabilities.\",362\n5590,SECURITY FOCUS,CVE-1999-1425,\"Security Focus provides a reference link for CVE-1999-1425, indicating its relevance in the security community\",362\n5587,SECURITY FOCUS,CVE-1999-1426,Security Focus provides a reference for CVE-1999-1426 in its vulnerability database,362\n6435,SECURITYFOCUS,CVE-1999-1427,SecurityFocus provides references and information regarding the vulnerability CVE-1999-1427,101\n4597,SUN,SOLARIS SOLSTICE ADMINSUITE,Sun Microsystems is the developer and vendor of the Solaris Solstice AdminSuite software.
