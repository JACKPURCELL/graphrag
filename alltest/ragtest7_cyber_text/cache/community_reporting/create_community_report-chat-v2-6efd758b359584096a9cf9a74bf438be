Various examples illustrate this concept, including specific vulnerabilities found in different systems and software.\n\nFor instance, a vulnerability in the passwd feature of SCO UNIX allows attackers to cause a denial of service. Similarly, vulnerabilities in SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 and in the kernel error handling routine of SCO OpenServer enable local users to gain root privileges, posing significant security risks. Other notable vulnerabilities include those in the BisonWare FTP Server, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service, and in CrackLib 2.5, which permits local users to gain root privileges via a long GECOS field.\n\nAdditionally, vulnerabilities such as the buffer overflow in the passwd command in BSD-based operating systems and the issues in Samba 1.9.18, which allows local users to gain privileges due to incorrect permissions, further exemplify the potential for exploitation. The vulnerabilities described in various CVEs, including CVE-1999-1216, CVE-1999-0831, and CVE-1999-1193, highlight the diverse nature of security flaws across different platforms, including Linux, NeXT NeXTstep, and others.\n\nOverall, vulnerabilities represent critical security issues that can be exploited by threats, necessitating ongoing vigilance and remediation efforts to protect systems from unauthorized access and potential harm.\",45\n3445,WINDOWMAKER,WindowMaker is a software that has multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands.,7\n162,AT&T SYSTEM V RELEASE 4,AT&T System V Release 4 is a version of the UNIX operating system that has a vulnerability allowing local users to gain privileges.,2\n1299,BSD TELNET CLIENT WITH ENCRYPTION AND KERBEROS 4 AUTHENTICATION,The BSD Telnet client with encryption and Kerberos 4 authentication is a version of the BSD Telnet client that includes security features but is still vulnerable to session decryption.,1\n2593,DATA,\"Data refers to information processed or stored by a computer, which can be vulnerable to various security threats.\",1\n2949,DESKTOP SEARCHBOOK,Desktop searchbook is a program within the IRIX operating system that has a known vulnerability related to insecure permissions for user files.,1\n2592,SECURITY,Security refers to the measures taken to protect a computer or computer system against unauthorized access or attack.,1\n353,BSD BASED OPERATING SYSTEMS,\"BSD based operating systems are a family of operating systems that are derived from the Berkeley Software Distribution, which includes various versions of Unix.\",1\n354,CA-1989-01,CA-1989-01 is a third-party advisory related to the buffer overflow vulnerability in BSD based operating systems.,1\n1617,CA-1989-07,CA-1989-07 is a third-party advisory related to the vulnerability in SunOS 4.0.x.,1\n3447,1999-08-22,The date when the vulnerabilities in WindowMaker were publicly disclosed.,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n124,MITRE,CVE-1999-1471,\"MITRE is the organization that assigned the CVE identifier CVE-1999-1471, which pertains to a buffer overflow vulnerability found in BSD-based operating systems.\",1824\n1048,MITRE,CVE-1999-1233,\"MITRE is responsible for assigning the CVE ID CVE-1999-1233 as part of their ongoing vulnerability management efforts.
