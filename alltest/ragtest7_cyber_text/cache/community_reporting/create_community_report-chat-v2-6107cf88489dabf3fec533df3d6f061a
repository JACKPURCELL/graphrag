This can occur through various interfaces, such as cmdlets executed via powershell.exe or interactive commands in a command-line interface. The execution of these commands can be monitored for unusual behavior and is often scrutinized for security purposes to ensure the integrity of the computer system.\",6\n26,PROCESS CREATION,\"Process Creation refers to the act of initiating a new process within an operating system. This event is significant for monitoring system activity, as it can indicate abnormal behaviors or potential malware activity if unusual processes are initiated. The process creation involves the initial construction of an executable, which may encompass one or more tasks or threads. It is particularly relevant for security monitoring, especially in scenarios involving remote access, where tracking process creation can help detect unauthorized or suspicious activities. Overall, Process Creation is a critical aspect of operating system functionality and security management.\",5\n33,OS API EXECUTION,\"OS API Execution refers to the process of executing operating system function or method calls by a process. It encompasses the utilization of operating system application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform various tasks. This concept is particularly significant in the context of malware detection, as monitoring OS API Execution can help identify potentially harmful activities by analyzing the interactions between software and the operating system.\",2\n44,SERVICE CREATION,\"Service Creation refers to the initial construction and addition of new services or daemons within an operating system. This process is exemplified by specific events such as Windows Event ID 4697 and can be observed in system logs, such as those found in /var/log for daemon logs. Additionally, Service Creation is significant for security monitoring, as it allows for the tracking and oversight of newly introduced services, ensuring that they do not pose a security risk to the system.\",1\n766,SCHEDULED JOB CREATION,\"Scheduled Job Creation is the initial construction of a new scheduled job, represented by Windows Event ID 4698 or /var/log cron logs.\",1\n767,WMI CREATION,\"WMI Creation is a data component that signifies the utilization of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) in the context of malware operations. It encompasses the initial construction of WMI objects, which includes elements such as filters, consumers, subscriptions, bindings, and providers, as indicated by Sysmon Event IDs 19-21.
