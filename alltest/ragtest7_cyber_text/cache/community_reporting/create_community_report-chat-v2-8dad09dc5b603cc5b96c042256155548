In this model, the cloud provider dynamically allocates machine resources, which can be advantageous for legitimate users but also presents opportunities for adversaries to exploit these resources for malicious operations. The serverless infrastructure complicates the tracing of adversarial activities, as it abstracts the underlying server management.
