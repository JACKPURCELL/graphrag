It is affected by the Microsoft HTML control vulnerability, which poses risks to users. Additionally, the browser utilized the Windows Media Player ActiveX object, which also had its own vulnerabilities. One significant issue with Internet Explorer 5.0 is its ability to allow a remote server to read arbitrary files on the client's file system through the Microsoft Scriptlet Component, raising serious privacy concerns.\n\nMoreover, Internet Explorer 5.0 is susceptible to window spoofing, a technique that enables remote attackers to impersonate legitimate websites, thereby capturing sensitive client information. During installation, the browser's setup wizard disabled certain system features, which could compromise security. Another critical vulnerability involves the management of username and password caches, which could allow unauthorized access to restricted websites. Furthermore, Internet Explorer 5.0 records usernames and passwords for FTP servers in the URL history, potentially exposing this sensitive information to local users or observers.
