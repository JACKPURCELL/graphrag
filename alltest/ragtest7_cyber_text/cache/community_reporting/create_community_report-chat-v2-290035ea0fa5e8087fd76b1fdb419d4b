The company offers a range of open-source software products, including the Red Hat Linux operating system and tools such as the Red Hat pump DHCP client and the net-tools package. \n\nRed Hat has been involved in addressing vulnerabilities within its software, including the Vixie Cron vulnerability and the CVE-1999-0698 vulnerability, which have affected its operating systems. Additionally, the Red Hat pump DHCP client has been noted for a vulnerability that could allow remote attackers to gain root access under certain configurations, and the net-tools package has reported a buffer overflow issue. Overall, Red Hat is a leading vendor of Linux operating systems, committed to maintaining the security and reliability of its open-source offerings.\",18\n863,RED HAT LINUX,\"Red Hat Linux is a Linux distribution developed by Red Hat, recognized for its enterprise-level support and commitment to open-source software solutions. It is a popular open-source operating system known for its stability and security, particularly in server environments. However, Red Hat Linux has faced several vulnerabilities over the years. Notably, versions 5.0 and earlier were affected by the ncftp vulnerability, while the Linuxconf vulnerability also impacted the distribution. Additionally, the operating system included the Squid package, which had a known vulnerability that allowed remote attackers to connect to other systems through cachemgr.cgi.\n\nRed Hat Linux has also experienced issues related to its Ethernet interface, which, if misconfigured, could lead to a denial of service. Furthermore, a buffer overflow vulnerability in SysVInit was present in version 5.1 and earlier, enabling local users to gain elevated privileges. The operating system's screen program did not utilize Unix98 ptys, allowing local users to write to other terminals, and there were vulnerabilities that permitted local users to bypass the execution of the .xsession file. One specific vulnerability identified was CVE-1999-1346, which further highlights the security challenges faced by Red Hat Linux.
