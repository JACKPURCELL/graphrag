This technique executes a specific script with root privileges upon user login, allowing attackers to maintain access to the system. The ability to run scripts with elevated privileges poses a significant security risk, as it can lead to unauthorized access and control over the system. Mitigation strategies are essential to counteract these threats and enhance overall security against such persistent attacks.
