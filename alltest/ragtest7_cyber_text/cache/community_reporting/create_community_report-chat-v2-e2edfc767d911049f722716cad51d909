It has been associated with numerous security vulnerabilities over the years, particularly in older versions. Notably, Sendmail versions prior to 8.6.7 allow local users to gain root access through a large value in the debug (-d) command line option. Additionally, vulnerabilities in versions 8.8.0 and 8.8.1 have been identified, which permit root access due to a MIME buffer overflow.\n\nSendmail has also been exploited by remote attackers, who can execute root commands using the ident protocol or cause denial of service (DoS) by processing ETRN commands after a connection has been terminated. Specific versions, such as 8.6.11 and 8.6.12, are particularly vulnerable to denial of service attacks. Furthermore, the software has been affected by a buffer overflow vulnerability in the SMTP HELO command, which allows attackers to hide their activities.\n\nLocal users can also exploit Sendmail to gain group permissions by manipulating .forward or :include: files, and they can reinitialize the aliases database using the newaliases command, potentially disrupting its operation. The software has been linked to various security incidents, including a Trojan Horse incident and the WIZ command issue.\n\nIn summary, Sendmail is a critical component for email communication on Unix-like systems, but it has a history of vulnerabilities that can be exploited for privilege escalation and denial of service, making it a frequent topic in security discussions.\",40\n3153,CVE-1999-0418,\"CVE-1999-0418 is a specific identifier for a vulnerability related to denial of service in SMTP applications, particularly affecting Sendmail.\",9\n1822,CVE-1999-0203,CVE-1999-0203 is a specific identifier for a vulnerability in Sendmail that allows attackers to gain root privileges.,6\n3040,CVE-1999-0204,CVE-1999-0204 is a specific identifier for a vulnerability in Sendmail 8.6.9 that allows remote command execution.,5\n566,CVE-1999-0206,CVE-1999-0206 is a specific identifier for a vulnerability in Sendmail that allows root access due to a buffer overflow.,5\n1091,CVE-1999-0129,\"CVE-1999-0129 is a specific identifier for a vulnerability in Sendmail that was published on September 29, 1999.CVE-1999-0129 is a published CVE identifier for a vulnerability in Sendmail that allows local users to gain group permissions.\",3\n4365,CVE-1999-0976,CVE-1999-0976 is a specific identifier for a vulnerability in Sendmail that allows local users to cause a denial of service.,3\n1098,CVE-1999-1309,CVE-1999-1309 is a public vulnerability identifier for the Sendmail issue that allows local users to gain root access.,2\n652,CVE-1999-0163,CVE-1999-0163 is a specific identifier for a vulnerability in Sendmail that allows an attacker to execute root commands using a pipe character in older versions.,2\n367,PROCMAIL,\"Procmail is a mail processing utility that is commonly utilized alongside Sendmail.
