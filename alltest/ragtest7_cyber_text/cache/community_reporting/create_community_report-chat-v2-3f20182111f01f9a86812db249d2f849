This attack pattern involves adversaries masquerading as a malicious DHCP server on the victim's network, allowing them to redirect network traffic by spoofing legitimate DHCP communications.

This data can be scrutinized for suspicious activities, particularly in the context of remote access technologies. Additionally, monitoring network traffic can help identify unusual activities, such as ARP poisoning, which may indicate potential security risks. Overall, the analysis of network traffic is crucial for maintaining network security and detecting potential threats.\",2\n53,ARP CACHE POISONING,\"ARP Cache Poisoning is a method employed by attackers to manipulate the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) caches within a network. This technique involves associating the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate device, thereby enabling the interception of communication between networked devices. By poisoning the ARP cache, adversaries can engage in follow-on behaviors such as network sniffing or data manipulation, which may lead to the collection of sensitive information, including user credentials.
