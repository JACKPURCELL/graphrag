It refers to a utility within the gzip package that enables users to execute compressed files. However, this utility has a notable vulnerability that permits local users to overwrite files belonging to other users, raising security concerns regarding its use.\",6\n866,SYMLINK ATTACK,\"The \"\"SYMLINK ATTACK\"\" refers to a type of security vulnerability that exploits symbolic links to manipulate file access permissions and potentially gain unauthorized access to files. This method is particularly relevant in the context of various software vulnerabilities, such as the shell-lock vulnerability and the addnetpr vulnerability found in SGI IRIX. \n\nIn a symlink attack, an attacker can create symbolic links to files, which allows them to modify permissions of files that are writable by the user. This exploitation can lead to the overwriting of files within a system, enabling unauthorized access or privilege escalation. The attack is characterized by its ability to allow local users to create or overwrite arbitrary files, thereby posing significant security risks.\n\nOverall, a symlink attack is a method that leverages symbolic links to exploit vulnerabilities in software, leading to potential unauthorized access, modification of files, and manipulation of file permissions.\",10\n3766,PERL,\"Perl is a programming language that has been associated with certain vulnerabilities in its earlier versions, specifically 5.004_04 and earlier.
