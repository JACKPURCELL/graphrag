It allows users to perform various computing tasks, run applications, and manage files on personal computers. The operating system is known for its vulnerabilities, including the CVE-1999-0391 and CVE-1999-0387 vulnerabilities, as well as being affected by the Jolt ICMP attack and a buffer overflow vulnerability in Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions. Additionally, Windows 95 is impacted by vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer 3.01 and the Netscape browser.\n\nThe operating system employs weak encryption for the password list (.pwl) file, which can allow local users to gain unauthorized privileges by decrypting passwords. When Remote Administration and File Sharing for NetWare Networks is enabled, it creates a share (C$) that can be exploited by remote attackers to read arbitrary files by mapping the network drive.\n\nWindows 95 also supports various software, including the Symantec Norton Utilities 2.0 and includes the Microsoft Telnet client.
