The format of each attack technique's information is as follows:\nAttack technique name: ***\nAttack technique description: ***\nPlatforms: ***\nThese respectively represent the name of the attack technique, a detailed description, and the platforms it can target.\n\nAttack technique name: Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts\nAttck technique description: Adversaries may use scripts automatically executed at boot or logon initialization to establish persistence.(Citation: Mandiant APT29 Eye Spy Email Nov 22)(Citation: Anomali Rocke March 2019) Initialization scripts can be used to perform administrative functions, which may often execute other programs or send information to an internal logging server. These scripts can vary based on operating system and whether applied locally or remotely.  \n\nAdversaries may use these scripts to maintain persistence on a single system. Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary. \n\nAn adversary may also be able to escalate their privileges since some boot or logon initialization scripts run with higher privileges.\nPlatforms: macOS, Windows, Linux, Network\n\nAttack technique name: Fileless Storage\nAttck technique description: Adversaries may store data in \"fileless\" formats to conceal malicious activity from defenses. Fileless storage can be broadly defined as any format other than a file. Common examples of non-volatile fileless storage include the Windows Registry, event logs, or WMI repository.(Citation: Microsoft Fileless)(Citation: SecureList Fileless)\n\nSimilar to fileless in-memory behaviors such as [Reflective Code Loading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1620) and [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055), fileless data storage may remain undetected by anti-virus and other endpoint security tools that can only access specific file formats from disk storage.\n\nAdversaries may use fileless storage to conceal various types of stored data, including payloads/shellcode (potentially being used as part of [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003)) and collected data not yet exfiltrated from the victim (e.g., [Local Data Staging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074/001)). Adversaries also often encrypt, encode, splice, or otherwise obfuscate this fileless data when stored.\n\nSome forms of fileless storage activity may indirectly create artifacts in the file system, but in central and otherwise difficult to inspect formats such as the WMI (e.g., `%SystemRoot%\\System32\\Wbem\\Repository`) or Registry (e.g., `%SystemRoot%\\System32\\Config`) physical files.(Citation: Microsoft Fileless) \nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: RC Scripts\nAttck technique description: Adversaries may establish persistence by modifying RC scripts which are executed during a Unix-like system’s startup. These files allow system administrators to map and start custom services at startup for different run levels. RC scripts require root privileges to modify.\n\nAdversaries can establish persistence by adding a malicious binary path or shell commands to <code>rc.local</code>, <code>rc.common</code>, and other RC scripts specific to the Unix-like distribution.(Citation: IranThreats Kittens Dec 2017)(Citation: Intezer HiddenWasp Map 2019) Upon reboot, the system executes the script's contents as root, resulting in persistence.\n\nAdversary abuse of RC scripts is especially effective for lightweight Unix-like distributions using the root user as default, such as IoT or embedded systems.(Citation: intezer-kaiji-malware)\n\nSeveral Unix-like systems have moved to Systemd and deprecated the use of RC scripts. This is now a deprecated mechanism in macOS in favor of [Launchd](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/004). (Citation: Apple Developer Doco Archive Launchd)(Citation: Startup Items) This technique can be used on Mac OS X Panther v10.3 and earlier versions which still execute the RC scripts.(Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence) To maintain backwards compatibility some systems, such as Ubuntu, will execute the RC scripts if they exist with the correct file permissions.(Citation: Ubuntu Manpage systemd rc)\nPlatforms: macOS, Linux, Network\n\nAttack technique name: Adversary-in-the-Middle\nAttck technique description: Adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices using an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) technique to support follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040), [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002), or replay attacks ([Exploitation for Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1212)). By abusing features of common networking protocols that can determine the flow of network traffic (e.g. ARP, DNS, LLMNR, etc.), adversaries may force a device to communicate through an adversary controlled system so they can collect information or perform additional actions.(Citation: Rapid7 MiTM Basics)\n\nFor example, adversaries may manipulate victim DNS settings to enable other malicious activities such as preventing/redirecting users from accessing legitimate sites and/or pushing additional malware.(Citation: ttint_rat)(Citation: dns_changer_trojans)(Citation: ad_blocker_with_miner) Adversaries may also manipulate DNS and leverage their position in order to intercept user credentials, including access tokens ([Steal Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528)) and session cookies ([Steal Web Session Cookie](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1539)).(Citation: v\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BOOT OR LOGON INITIALIZATION SCRIPTS<|>EVENT<|>A technique where adversaries use scripts executed at boot or logon to establish persistence on a system.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FILELESS STORAGE<|>EVENT<|>A technique where adversaries store data in non-file formats to conceal malicious activities from defenses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RC SCRIPTS<|>EVENT<|>A technique where adversaries modify RC scripts in Unix-like systems to establish persistence during startup.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADVERSARY-IN-THE-MIDDLE<|>EVENT<|>A technique where adversaries position themselves between networked devices to intercept or manipulate data.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>GEO<|>An operating system that can be targeted by various attack techniques including Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts and RC Scripts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>GEO<|>An operating system that can be targeted by various attack techniques including Fileless Storage and Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>GEO<|>An operating system that can be targeted by various attack techniques including RC Scripts and Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NETWORK<|>GEO<|>A system that can be targeted by various attack techniques including Adversary-in-the-Middle and RC Scripts.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOOT OR LOGON INITIALIZATION SCRIPTS<|>WINDOWS<|>Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts can be executed on Windows operating systems to establish persistence.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOOT OR LOGON INITIALIZATION SCRIPTS<|>MACOS<|>Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts can be executed on macOS operating systems to establish persistence.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOOT OR LOGON INITIALIZATION SCRIPTS<|>LINUX<|>Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts can be executed on Linux operating systems to establish persistence.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FILELESS STORAGE<|>WINDOWS<|>Fileless Storage is a technique that can be used on Windows operating systems to conceal malicious activities.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RC SCRIPTS<|>LINUX<|>RC Scripts are used in Linux systems to establish persistence during startup.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RC SCRIPTS<|>MACOS<|>RC Scripts can be executed on macOS systems to establish persistence during startup.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADVERSARY-IN-THE-MIDDLE<|>NETWORK<|>Adversary-in-the-Middle techniques are used to intercept or manipulate data in network communications.<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
