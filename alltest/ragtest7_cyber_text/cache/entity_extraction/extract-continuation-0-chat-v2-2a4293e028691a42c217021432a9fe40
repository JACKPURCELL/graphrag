These scripts can vary based on operating system and whether applied locally or remotely.  \n\nAdversaries may use these scripts to maintain persistence on a single system. Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary. \n\nAn adversary may also be able to escalate their privileges since some boot or logon initialization scripts run with higher privileges.\nIs Subtechnique: False\nPlatforms: macOS, Windows, Linux, Network\nExternal URL: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037\n\nName: RC Scripts\nDescription: Adversaries may establish persistence by modifying RC scripts which are executed during a Unix-like system’s startup. These files allow system administrators to map and start custom services at startup for different run levels. RC scripts require root privileges to modify.\n\nAdversaries can establish persistence by adding a malicious binary path or shell commands to <code>rc.local</code>, <code>rc.common</code>, and other RC scripts specific to the Unix-like distribution.(Citation: IranThreats Kittens Dec 2017)(Citation: Intezer HiddenWasp Map 2019) Upon reboot, the system executes the script's contents as root, resulting in persistence.\n\nAdversary abuse of RC scripts is especially effective for lightweight Unix-like distributions using the root user as default, such as IoT or embedded systems.(Citation: intezer-kaiji-malware)\n\nSeveral Unix-like systems have moved to Systemd and deprecated the use of RC scripts. This is now a deprecated mechanism in macOS in favor of [Launchd](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/004). (Citation: Apple Developer Doco Archive Launchd)(Citation: Startup Items) This technique can be used on Mac OS X Panther v10.3 and earlier versions which still execute the RC scripts.(Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence) To maintain backwards compatibility some systems, such as Ubuntu, will execute the RC scripts if they exist with the correct file permissions.(Citation: Ubuntu Manpage systemd rc)\nIs Subtechnique: True\nPlatforms: macOS, Linux, Network\nExternal URL: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/004\n\nName: Logon Script (Windows)\nDescription: Adversaries may use Windows logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence. Windows allows logon scripts to be run whenever a specific user or group of users log into a system.(Citation: TechNet Logon Scripts) This is done via adding a path to a script to the <code>HKCU\\Environment\\UserInitMprLogonScript</code> Registry key.(Citation: Hexacorn Logon Scripts)\n\nAdversaries may use these scripts to maintain persistence on a single system. Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary. \nIs Subtechnique: True\nPlatforms: Windows\nExternal URL: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/001\n\nName: Network Logon Script\nDescription: Adversaries may use network logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence. Network logon scripts can be assigned using Active Directory or Group Policy Objects.(Citation: Petri Logon Script AD) These logon scripts run with the privileges of the user they are assigned to. Depending on the systems within the network, initializing one of these scripts could apply to more than one or potentially all systems.  \n \nAdversaries may use these scripts to maintain persistence on a network. Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary.\nIs Subtechnique: True\nPlatforms: Windows\nExternal URL: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/003\n\nName: Startup Items\nDescription: Adversaries may use startup items automatically executed at boot initialization to establish persistence. Startup items execute during the final phase of the boot process and contain shell scripts or other executable files along with configuration information used by the system to determine the execution order for all startup items.(Citation: Startup Items)\n\nThis is technically a deprecated technology (superseded by [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004)), and thus the appropriate folder, <code>/Library/StartupItems</code> isn’t guaranteed to exist on the system by default, but does appear to exist by default on macOS Sierra. A startup item is a directory whose executable and configuration property list (plist), <code>StartupParameters.plist</code>, reside in the top-level directory. \n\nAn adversary can create the appropriate folders/files in the StartupItems directory to register their own persistence mechanism.(Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence) Additionally, since StartupItems run during the bootup phase of macOS, they will run as the elevated root user.\nIs Subtechnique: True\nPlatforms: macOS\nExternal URL: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/005\n\nName: Login Hook\nDescription: Adversaries may use a Login Hook to establish persistence executed upon user logon. A login hook is a plist file that points to a specific script to execute with root privileges upon user log\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BOOT OR LOGON INITIALIZATION SCRIPTS<|>EVENT<|>Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts are techniques used by adversaries to establish persistence on a system by executing scripts automatically at boot or logon initialization.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RC SCRIPTS<|>EVENT<|>RC Scripts are used by adversaries to establish persistence during a Unix-like system's startup by modifying scripts that require root privileges to execute.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOGON SCRIPT (WINDOWS)<|>EVENT<|>Windows Logon Scripts are automatically executed at logon initialization to maintain persistence on a Windows system.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NETWORK LOGON SCRIPT<|>EVENT<|>Network Logon Scripts are executed at logon initialization and can be assigned using Active Directory or Group Policy Objects to maintain persistence across a network.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STARTUP ITEMS<|>EVENT<|>Startup Items are executed during the boot process to establish persistence, containing shell scripts or executable files that run as the elevated root user.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOGIN HOOK<|>EVENT<|>Login Hooks are scripts executed with root privileges upon user logon to establish persistence on a system.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOOT OR LOGON INITIALIZATION SCRIPTS<|>RC SCRIPTS<|>Both Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts and RC Scripts are techniques used by adversaries to establish persistence on systems during startup or logon processes.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOOT OR LOGON INITIALIZATION SCRIPTS<|>LOGON SCRIPT (WINDOWS)<|>Both techniques involve the execution of scripts at logon to maintain persistence on systems, albeit in different operating environments.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOGON SCRIPT (WINDOWS)<|>NETWORK LOGON SCRIPT<|>Both Logon Scripts and Network Logon Scripts are executed at logon initialization to maintain persistence, with the latter being applicable across a network.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STARTUP ITEMS<|>LOGIN HOOK<|>Both Startup Items and Login Hooks are mechanisms used to establish persistence on a system, executed during the boot process or user logon.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
