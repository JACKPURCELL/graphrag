Writing payloads to shared sections also avoids the use of highly monitored API calls such as <code>WriteProcessMemory</code> and <code>CreateRemoteThread</code>.(Citation: Elastic Process Injection July 2017) More sophisticated malware samples may also potentially bypass protection mechanisms such as data execution prevention (DEP) by triggering a combination of windows procedures and other system functions that will rewrite the malicious payload inside an executable portion of the target process.  (Citation: MalwareTech Power Loader Aug 2013) (Citation: WeLiveSecurity Gapz and Redyms Mar 2013)\n\nRunning code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via EWM injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. \nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Screen Capture\nAttck technique description: Adversaries may attempt to take screen captures of the desktop to gather information over the course of an operation. Screen capturing functionality may be included as a feature of a remote access tool used in post-compromise operations. Taking a screenshot is also typically possible through native utilities or API calls, such as <code>CopyFromScreen</code>, <code>xwd</code>, or <code>screencapture</code>.(Citation: CopyFromScreen .NET)(Citation: Antiquated Mac Malware)\n\nPlatforms: Linux, macOS, Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Startup Items\nAttck technique description: Adversaries may use startup items automatically executed at boot initialization to establish persistence. Startup items execute during the final phase of the boot process and contain shell scripts or other executable files along with configuration information used by the system to determine the execution order for all startup items.(Citation: Startup Items)\n\nThis is technically a deprecated technology (superseded by [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004)), and thus the appropriate folder, <code>/Library/StartupItems</code> isn’t guaranteed to exist on the system by default, but does appear to exist by default on macOS Sierra. A startup item is a directory whose executable and configuration property list (plist), <code>StartupParameters.plist</code>, reside in the top-level directory. \n\nAn adversary can create the appropriate folders/files in the StartupItems directory to register their own persistence mechanism.(Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence) Additionally, since StartupItems run during the bootup phase of macOS, they will run as the elevated root user.\nPlatforms: macOS\n\nAttack technique name: VNC\nAttck technique description: Adversaries may use [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to remotely control machines using Virtual Network Computing (VNC).  VNC is a platform-independent desktop sharing system that uses the RFB (“remote framebuffer”) protocol to enable users to remotely control another computer’s display by relaying the screen, mouse, and keyboard inputs over the network.(Citation: The Remote Framebuffer Protocol)\n\nVNC differs from [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/001) as VNC is screen-sharing software rather than resource-sharing software. By default, VNC uses the system's authentication, but it can be configured to use credentials specific to VNC.(Citation: MacOS VNC software for Remote Desktop)(Citation: VNC Authentication)\n\nAdversaries may abuse VNC to perform malicious actions as the logged-on user such as opening documents, downloading files, and running arbitrary commands. An adversary could use VNC to remotely control and monitor a system to collect data and information to pivot to other systems within the network. Specific VNC libraries/implementations have also been susceptible to brute force attacks and memory usage exploitation.(Citation: Hijacking VNC)(Citation: macOS root VNC login without authentication)(Citation: VNC Vulnerabilities)(Citation: Offensive Security VNC Authentication Check)(Citation: Attacking VNC Servers PentestLab)(Citation: Havana authentication bug)\nPlatforms: Linux, macOS, Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Logon Script (Windows)\nAttck technique description: Adversaries may use Windows logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence. Windows allows logon scripts to be run whenever a specific user or group of users log into a system.(Citation: TechNet Logon Scripts) This is done via adding a path to a script to the <code>HKCU\\Environment\\UserInitMprLogonScript</code> Registry key.(Citation: Hexacorn Logon Scripts)\n\nAdversaries may use these scripts to maintain persistence on a single system. Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary. \nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Scheduled Task\nAttck technique description: Adversaries may abuse the Windows Task Scheduler to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. There are multiple ways to access the Task Scheduler in Windows. The [schtasks](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0111) utility can be run directly on the command line, or the Task Scheduler can be opened through the GUI within the Administrator Tools section of the Control Panel. In some cases, adversaries have used a .NET wrapper for the Windows Task Scheduler, and alternatively, adversaries have used the Windows netapi32 library to create a scheduled task.\n\nThe deprecated [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) utility could also be abused by adversaries (ex: [At](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EWM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>EWM refers to the execution control mechanism in a process that allows for the injection of code and manipulation of process memory.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MALWARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Malware is software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems, often utilizing techniques like EWM injection.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>GEO<|>Windows is an operating system platform that supports various attack techniques including EWM injection and screen capture.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>GEO<|>Linux is an operating system platform that supports various attack techniques including screen capture and VNC.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>GEO<|>macOS is an operating system platform that supports various attack techniques including screen capture and startup items.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCREEN CAPTURE<|>EVENT<|>Screen capture is an attack technique where adversaries take screenshots of the desktop to gather information during an operation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STARTUP ITEMS<|>EVENT<|>Startup items are scripts or executables that run automatically during the boot process to establish persistence for malware.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VNC<|>EVENT<|>VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is a remote desktop sharing system that allows users to control another computer's display over a network.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOGON SCRIPT<|>EVENT<|>Logon scripts are scripts that run automatically when a user logs into a Windows system, which can be exploited for persistence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCHEDULED TASK<|>EVENT<|>Scheduled tasks are tasks that can be set to run at specific times or intervals, which can be abused to execute malicious code.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MALWARE<|>EWM<|>Malware utilizes EWM injection techniques to manipulate process memory and execute malicious payloads<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINDOWS<|>MALWARE<|>Windows is a platform that malware targets for executing various attack techniques<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINUX<|>MALWARE<|>Linux is a platform that malware can target for executing various attack techniques<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MACOS<|>MALWARE<|>macOS is a platform that malware can target for executing various attack techniques<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCREEN CAPTURE<|>MALWARE<|>Malware may use screen capture techniques to gather information during an operation<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STARTUP ITEMS<|>MALWARE<|>Malware can create startup items to maintain persistence on macOS systems<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VNC<|>MALWARE<|>Malware may use VNC to remotely control systems and perform malicious actions<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOGON SCRIPT<|>MALWARE<|>Malware can exploit logon scripts to establish persistence on Windows systems<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHEDULED TASK<|>MALWARE<|>Malware can abuse scheduled tasks to execute malicious code at specific times<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
