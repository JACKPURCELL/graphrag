WMIC will be removed from subsequent Windows releases and replaced by [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) as the primary WMI interface.(Citation: WMI 7,8) In addition to PowerShell and tools like `wbemtool.exe`, COM APIs can also be used to programmatically interact with WMI via C++, .NET, VBScript, etc.(Citation: WMI 7,8)\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: ARP Cache Poisoning\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may poison Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) caches to position themselves between the communication of two or more networked devices. This activity may be used to enable follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002).\n\nThe ARP protocol is used to resolve IPv4 addresses to link layer addresses, such as a media access control (MAC) address.(Citation: RFC826 ARP) Devices in a local network segment communicate with each other by using link layer addresses. If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address. The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address. The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.\n\nAn adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of the requesting device. The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device. For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner. Adversaries may also send a gratuitous ARP reply that maliciously announces the ownership of a particular IP address to all the devices in the local network segment.\n\nThe ARP protocol is stateless and does not require authentication. Therefore, devices may wrongly add or update the MAC address of the IP address in their ARP cache.(Citation: Sans ARP Spoofing Aug 2003)(Citation: Cylance Cleaver)\n\nAdversaries may use ARP cache poisoning as a means to intercept network traffic. This activity may be used to collect and/or relay data such as credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol.(Citation: Sans ARP Spoofing Aug 2003)\n\nPlatforms: Linux, Windows, macOS\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) is a Microsoft technology for managing data and operations on Windows-based operating systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WMIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) is a command-line utility for WMI that allows users to perform management tasks on Windows systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POWERSELL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and associated scripting language.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARP CACHE POISONING<|>EVENT<|>ARP Cache Poisoning is a network attack technique where an adversary poisons the Address Resolution Protocol caches to intercept network traffic.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>GEO<|>Windows is a family of operating systems developed by Microsoft, widely used in personal computers and servers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>GEO<|>Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, widely used in servers and desktops.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>GEO<|>macOS is a series of proprietary graphical operating systems developed by Apple Inc. for their Mac computers.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WMIC<|>WMI<|>WMIC is a command-line utility that interacts with WMI to perform management tasks on Windows systems.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POWERSELL<|>WMI<|>PowerShell is used to programmatically interact with WMI for management tasks on Windows systems.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARP CACHE POISONING<|>WINDOWS<|>ARP Cache Poisoning can be executed on Windows platforms to intercept network traffic.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARP CACHE POISONING<|>LINUX<|>ARP Cache Poisoning can be executed on Linux platforms to intercept network traffic.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARP CACHE POISONING<|>MACOS<|>ARP Cache Poisoning can be executed on macOS platforms to intercept network traffic.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
