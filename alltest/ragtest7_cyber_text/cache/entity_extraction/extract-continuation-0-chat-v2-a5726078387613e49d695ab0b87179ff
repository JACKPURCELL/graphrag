The group works on behalf of the Iranian government based on infrastructure details that contain references to Iran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests.(Citation: FireEye APT34 Dec 2017)(Citation: Palo Alto OilRig April 2017)(Citation: ClearSky OilRig Jan 2017)(Citation: Palo Alto OilRig May 2016)(Citation: Palo Alto OilRig Oct 2016)(Citation: Unit42 OilRig Playbook 2023)(Citation: Unit 42 QUADAGENT July 2018)\nAliases: OilRig, COBALT GYPSY, IRN2, APT34, Helix Kitten, Evasive Serpens, Hazel Sandstorm, EUROPIUM\nRevoked: False\nExternal URL: https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0049\nExternal References:\nSource Name: IRN2, Description: (Citation: Crowdstrike Helix Kitten Nov 2018), URL: None\nSource Name: Hazel Sandstorm, Description: (Citation: Microsoft Threat Actor Naming July 2023), URL: None\nSource Name: EUROPIUM, Description: (Citation: Microsoft Threat Actor Naming July 2023), URL: None\nSource Name: OilRig, Description: (Citation: Palo Alto OilRig April 2017) (Citation: ClearSky OilRig Jan 2017) (Citation: Palo Alto OilRig May 2016) (Citation: Palo Alto OilRig Oct 2016) (Citation: Unit 42 Playbook Dec 2017) (Citation: Unit 42 QUADAGENT July 2018), URL: None\nSource Name: COBALT GYPSY, Description: (Citation: Secureworks COBALT GYPSY Threat Profile), URL: None\nSource Name: Helix Kitten, Description: (Citation: Unit 42 QUADAGENT July 2018)(Citation: Crowdstrike Helix Kitten Nov 2018), URL: None\nSource Name: Evasive Serpens, Description: (Citation: Unit42 OilRig Playbook 2023), URL: None\nSource Name: Check Point APT34 April 2021, Description: Check Point.
