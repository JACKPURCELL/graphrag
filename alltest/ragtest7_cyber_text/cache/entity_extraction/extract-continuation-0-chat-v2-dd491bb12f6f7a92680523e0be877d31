When the network interface receives a packet matching the filter criteria, additional actions can be triggered on the host, such as activation of a reverse shell.\n\nTo establish a connection, an adversary sends a crafted packet to the targeted host that matches the installed filter criteria.(Citation: haking9 libpcap network sniffing) Adversaries have used these socket filters to trigger the installation of implants, conduct ping backs, and to invoke command shells. Communication with these socket filters may also be used in conjunction with [Protocol Tunneling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572).(Citation: exatrack bpf filters passive backdoors)(Citation: Leonardo Turla Penquin May 2020)\n\nFilters can be installed on any Unix-like platform with `libpcap` installed or on Windows hosts using `Winpcap`.  Adversaries may use either `libpcap` with `pcap_setfilter` or the standard library function `setsockopt` with `SO_ATTACH_FILTER` options. Since the socket connection is not active until the packet is received, this behavior may be difficult to detect due to the lack of activity on a host, low CPU overhead, and limited visibility into raw socket usage.\nContributors: Tim (Wadhwa-)Brown, CrowdStrike\nData Sources: Process: Process Creation, Network Traffic: Network Connection Creation\nDetection: Identify running processes with raw sockets.

By achieving the adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) position, adversaries may collect network communications, including passed credentials, especially those sent over insecure, unencrypted protocols. This may also enable follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002).\n\nDHCP is based on a client-server model and has two functionalities: a protocol for providing network configuration settings from a DHCP server to a client and a mechanism for allocating network addresses to clients.(Citation: rfc2131) The typical server-client interaction is as follows: \n\n1. The client broadcasts a `DISCOVER` message.\n\n2. The server responds with an `OFFER` message, which includes an available network address. \n\n3. The client broadcasts a `REQUEST` message, which includes the network address offered. \n\n4. The server acknowledges with an `ACK` message and the client receives the network configuration parameters.\n\nAdversaries may spoof as a rogue DHCP server on the victim network, from which legitimate hosts may receive malicious network configurations. For example, malware can act as a DHCP server and provide adversary-owned DNS servers to the victimized computers.(Citation: new_rogue_DHCP_serv_malware)(Citation: w32.tidserv.g) Through the malicious network configurations, an adversary may achieve the AiTM position, route client traffic through adversary-controlled systems, and collect information from the client network.\n\nDHCPv6 clients can receive network configuration information without being assigned an IP address by sending a <code>INFORMATION-REQUEST (code 11)</code> message to the <code>All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers</code> multicast address.(Citation: rfc3315) Adversaries may use their rogue DHCP server to respond to this request message with malicious network configurations.\n\nRather than establishing an AiTM position, adversaries may also abuse DHCP spoofing to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DHCP SPOOFING<|>EVENT<|>DHCP Spoofing is an attack pattern where adversaries redirect network traffic by spoofing DHCP traffic and acting as a malicious DHCP server on the victim network.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIM WADHWA-BROWN<|>PERSON<|>Tim Wadhwa-Brown is a contributor to the documentation regarding network security and attack patterns.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CROWDSTRIKE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity technology company that provides threat intelligence and security solutions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIBPCAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Libpcap is a packet capture library used for network traffic analysis on Unix-like platforms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINPCAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Winpcap is a Windows packet capture library that allows applications to capture and transmit network packets.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEONARDO TURLA<|>PERSON<|>Leonardo Turla is a contributor to the documentation regarding malware technical insights.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAKIN9<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hakin9 is a publication focused on cybersecurity and hacking techniques.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TIM WADHWA-BROWN<|>CROWDSTRIKE<|>Tim Wadhwa-Brown is a contributor to CrowdStrike's documentation on network security.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEONARDO TURLA<|>CROWDSTRIKE<|>Leonardo Turla contributed to the documentation regarding malware insights published by CrowdStrike.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LIBPCAP<|>WINPCAP<|>Libpcap and Winpcap are both libraries used for packet capture on different operating systems.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAKIN9<|>TIM WADHWA-BROWN<|>Hakin9 published articles contributed by Tim Wadhwa-Brown on network security topics.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAKIN9<|>LEONARDO TURLA<|>Hakin9 published articles contributed by Leonardo Turla on malware technical insights.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
