This activity may be used to enable follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002).\n\nThe ARP protocol is used to resolve IPv4 addresses to link layer addresses, such as a media access control (MAC) address.(Citation: RFC826 ARP) Devices in a local network segment communicate with each other by using link layer addresses. If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address. The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address. The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.\n\nAn adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of the requesting device. The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device. For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner. Adversaries may also send a gratuitous ARP reply that maliciously announces the ownership of a particular IP address to all the devices in the local network segment.\n\nThe ARP protocol is stateless and does not require authentication. Therefore, devices may wrongly add or update the MAC address of the IP address in their ARP cache.(Citation: Sans ARP Spoofing Aug 2003)(Citation: Cylance Cleaver)\n\nAdversaries may use ARP cache poisoning as a means to intercept network traffic. This activity may be used to collect and/or relay data such as credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol.(Citation: Sans ARP Spoofing Aug 2003)\n\nIs Subtechnique: True\nPlatforms: Linux, Windows, macOS\nExternal URL: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/002\n\nAttack technique name: LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay\nDescription: By responding to LLMNR/NBT-NS network traffic, adversaries may spoof an authoritative source for name resolution to force communication with an adversary controlled system. This activity may be used to collect or relay authentication materials. \n\nLink-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) are Microsoft Windows components that serve as alternate methods of host identification. LLMNR is based upon the Domain Name System (DNS) format and allows hosts on the same local link to perform name resolution for other hosts. NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name. (Citation: Wikipedia LLMNR)(Citation: TechNet NetBIOS)\n\nAdversaries can spoof an authoritative source for name resolution on a victim network by responding to LLMNR (UDP 5355)/NBT-NS (UDP 137) traffic as if they know the identity of the requested host, effectively poisoning the service so that the victims will communicate with the adversary controlled system. If the requested host belongs to a resource that requires identification/authentication, the username and NTLMv2 hash will then be sent to the adversary controlled system. The adversary can then collect the hash information sent over the wire through tools that monitor the ports for traffic or through [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) and crack the hashes offline through [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110) to obtain the plaintext passwords.\n\nIn some cases where an adversary has access to a system that is in the authentication path between systems or when automated scans that use credentials attempt to authenticate to an adversary controlled system, the NTLMv1/v2 hashes can be intercepted and relayed to access and execute code against a target system. The relay step can happen in conjunction with poisoning but may also be independent of it.(Citation: byt3bl33d3r NTLM Relaying)(Citation: Secure Ideas SMB Relay) Additionally, adversaries may encapsulate the NTLMv1/v2 hashes into various protocols, such as LDAP, SMB, MSSQL and HTTP, to expand and use multiple services with the valid NTLM response. \n\nSeveral tools may be used to poison name services within local networks such as NBNSpoof, Metasploit, and [Responder](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0174).(Citation: GitHub NBNSpoof)(Citation: Rapid7 LLMNR Spoofer)(Citation: GitHub Responder)\nIs Subtechnique: True\nPlatforms: Windows\nExternal URL: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/001\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ARP CACHE POISONING<|>EVENT<|>ARP Cache Poisoning is an attack technique where adversaries poison Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) caches to intercept communication between networked devices, enabling follow-on behaviors such as network sniffing or data manipulation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LLMNR/NBT-NS POISONING AND SMB RELAY<|>EVENT<|>LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay is an attack technique where adversaries spoof name resolution services to collect or relay authentication materials by forcing communication with an adversary-controlled system.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Linux is an operating system platform that can be affected by various network attack techniques including ARP Cache Poisoning and LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Windows is an operating system platform that is susceptible to LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay attacks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>macOS is an operating system platform that can be impacted by ARP Cache Poisoning and LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARP CACHE POISONING<|>LINUX<|>ARP Cache Poisoning can be executed on Linux platforms, making them vulnerable to this attack technique.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARP CACHE POISONING<|>WINDOWS<|>ARP Cache Poisoning can be executed on Windows platforms, making them vulnerable to this attack technique.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARP CACHE POISONING<|>MACOS<|>ARP Cache Poisoning can be executed on macOS platforms, making them vulnerable to this attack technique.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LLMNR/NBT-NS POISONING AND SMB RELAY<|>WINDOWS<|>LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay is specifically designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Windows platforms.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LLMNR/NBT-NS POISONING AND SMB RELAY<|>LINUX<|>LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning can also affect Linux platforms, although it is primarily associated with Windows.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
