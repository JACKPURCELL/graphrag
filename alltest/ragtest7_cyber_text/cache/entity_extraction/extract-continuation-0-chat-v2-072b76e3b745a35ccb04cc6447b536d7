The format of each attack technique's information is as follows:\nAttack technique name: ***\nAttack technique description: ***\nPlatforms: ***\nThese respectively represent the name of the attack technique, a detailed description, and the platforms it can target.\n\nAttack technique name: LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay\nAttack technique description: By responding to LLMNR/NBT-NS network traffic, adversaries may spoof an authoritative source for name resolution to force communication with an adversary controlled system. This activity may be used to collect or relay authentication materials. \n\nLink-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) are Microsoft Windows components that serve as alternate methods of host identification. LLMNR is based upon the Domain Name System (DNS) format and allows hosts on the same local link to perform name resolution for other hosts. NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name. (Citation: Wikipedia LLMNR)(Citation: TechNet NetBIOS)\n\nAdversaries can spoof an authoritative source for name resolution on a victim network by responding to LLMNR (UDP 5355)/NBT-NS (UDP 137) traffic as if they know the identity of the requested host, effectively poisoning the service so that the victims will communicate with the adversary controlled system. If the requested host belongs to a resource that requires identification/authentication, the username and NTLMv2 hash will then be sent to the adversary controlled system. The adversary can then collect the hash information sent over the wire through tools that monitor the ports for traffic or through [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) and crack the hashes offline through [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110) to obtain the plaintext passwords.\n\nIn some cases where an adversary has access to a system that is in the authentication path between systems or when automated scans that use credentials attempt to authenticate to an adversary controlled system, the NTLMv1/v2 hashes can be intercepted and relayed to access and execute code against a target system. The relay step can happen in conjunction with poisoning but may also be independent of it.(Citation: byt3bl33d3r NTLM Relaying)(Citation: Secure Ideas SMB Relay) Additionally, adversaries may encapsulate the NTLMv1/v2 hashes into various protocols, such as LDAP, SMB, MSSQL and HTTP, to expand and use multiple services with the valid NTLM response. \n\nSeveral tools may be used to poison name services within local networks such as NBNSpoof, Metasploit, and [Responder](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0174).(Citation: GitHub NBNSpoof)(Citation: Rapid7 LLMNR Spoofer)(Citation: GitHub Responder)\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Login Hook\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may use a Login Hook to establish persistence executed upon user logon. A login hook is a plist file that points to a specific script to execute with root privileges upon user logon. The plist file is located in the <code>/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist</code> file and can be modified using the <code>defaults</code> command-line utility. This behavior is the same for logout hooks where a script can be executed upon user logout. All hooks require administrator permissions to modify or create hooks.(Citation: Login Scripts Apple Dev)(Citation: LoginWindowScripts Apple Dev) \n\nAdversaries can add or insert a path to a malicious script in the <code>com.apple.loginwindow.plist</code> file, using the <code>LoginHook</code> or <code>LogoutHook</code> key-value pair. The malicious script is executed upon the next user login. If a login hook already exists, adversaries can add additional commands to an existing login hook. There can be only one login and logout hook on a system at a time.(Citation: S1 macOs Persistence)(Citation: Wardle Persistence Chapter)\n\n**Note:** Login hooks were deprecated in 10.11 version of macOS in favor of [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004) and [Launch Agent](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/001) \nPlatforms: macOS\n\nAttack technique name: Archive via Utility\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may use utilities to compress and/or encrypt collected data prior to exfiltration. Many utilities include functionalities to compress, encrypt, or otherwise package data into a format that is easier/more secure to transport.\n\nAdversaries may abuse various utilities to compress or encrypt data before exfiltration. Some third party utilities may be preinstalled, such as <code>tar</code> on Linux and macOS or <code>zip</code> on Windows systems. \n\nOn Windows, <code>diantz</code> or <code> makecab</code> may be used to package collected files into a cabinet (.cab) file. <code>diantz</code> may also be used to download and compress files from remote locations (i.e. [Remote Data Staging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074/002)).(Citation: diantz.exe_lolbas) <code>xcopy</code> on Windows can copy files and directories with a variety of options. Additionally, adversaries may use [certutil](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0160) to Base64 encode collected data before exfiltration. \n\nAdversaries may use also third party utilities, such as 7-Zip, WinRAR, and WinZip, to perform similar activities.(Citation: 7\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LLMNR/NBT-NS POISONING AND SMB RELAY<|>EVENT<|>An attack technique that involves spoofing an authoritative source for name resolution to collect or relay authentication materials on a victim network.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOGIN HOOK<|>EVENT<|>An attack technique that establishes persistence by executing a script with root privileges upon user logon through a modified plist file.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARCHIVE VIA UTILITY<|>EVENT<|>An attack technique where adversaries use utilities to compress and/or encrypt collected data prior to exfiltration.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>GEO<|>An operating system platform that supports various attack techniques including LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay and Archive via Utility.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>GEO<|>An operating system platform that supports the Login Hook attack technique.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>GEO<|>An operating system platform that supports the Archive via Utility attack technique.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LLMNR/NBT-NS POISONING AND SMB RELAY<|>WINDOWS<|>LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay is an attack technique that targets Windows systems<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOGIN HOOK<|>MACOS<|>Login Hook is an attack technique that targets macOS systems for establishing persistence<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARCHIVE VIA UTILITY<|>WINDOWS<|>Archive via Utility is an attack technique that can be executed on Windows systems to compress and encrypt data<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARCHIVE VIA UTILITY<|>LINUX<|>Archive via Utility is an attack technique that can be executed on Linux systems to compress and encrypt data<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
