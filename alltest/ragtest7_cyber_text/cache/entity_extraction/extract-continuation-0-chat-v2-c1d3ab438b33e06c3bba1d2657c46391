A login hook is a plist file that points to a specific script to execute with root privileges upon user logon. The plist file is located in the <code>/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist</code> file and can be modified using the <code>defaults</code> command-line utility. This behavior is the same for logout hooks where a script can be executed upon user logout. All hooks require administrator permissions to modify or create hooks.(Citation: Login Scripts Apple Dev)(Citation: LoginWindowScripts Apple Dev) \n\nAdversaries can add or insert a path to a malicious script in the <code>com.apple.loginwindow.plist</code> file, using the <code>LoginHook</code> or <code>LogoutHook</code> key-value pair. The malicious script is executed upon the next user login. If a login hook already exists, adversaries can add additional commands to an existing login hook. There can be only one login and logout hook on a system at a time.(Citation: S1 macOs Persistence)(Citation: Wardle Persistence Chapter)\n\n**Note:** Login hooks were deprecated in 10.11 version of macOS in favor of [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004) and [Launch Agent](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/001) \nContributors: None\nData Sources: File: File Creation, File: File Modification, Process: Process Creation, Command: Command Execution\nDetection: Monitor logon scripts for unusual\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>COPYFROMSCREEN<|>EVENT<|>CopyFromScreen is a .NET method used for capturing the screen content in Windows applications.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANTIQUE MAC MALWARE<|>EVENT<|>Antiquated Mac Malware refers to a new backdoor using outdated code that targets macOS systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>GEO<|>Linux is an open-source operating system that is widely used for various applications, including server environments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>GEO<|>macOS is an operating system developed by Apple Inc. for Macintosh computers, known for its user-friendly interface and robust performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>GEO<|>Windows is a widely used operating system developed by Microsoft, known for its graphical user interface and extensive software compatibility.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STARTUP ITEMS<|>EVENT<|>Startup Items are mechanisms in macOS that allow programs to run automatically during the boot process to establish persistence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOGIN HOOK<|>EVENT<|>Login Hook is a plist file in macOS that executes a specific script with root privileges upon user logon.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COPYFROMSCREEN<|>ANTIQUE MAC MALWARE<|>Both CopyFromScreen and Antiquated Mac Malware involve methods of capturing or manipulating screen data in different operating systems<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STARTUP ITEMS<|>LOGIN HOOK<|>Both Startup Items and Login Hooks are mechanisms used in macOS to establish persistence during the boot or login process<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINUX<|>MACOS<|>Both Linux and macOS are operating systems that can be used for various applications, but they have different architectures and user bases<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINDOWS<|>MACOS<|>Both Windows and macOS are popular operating systems used in personal computing, but they cater to different user preferences and software ecosystems<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
