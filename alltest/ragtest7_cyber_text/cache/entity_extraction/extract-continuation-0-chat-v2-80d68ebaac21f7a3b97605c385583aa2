These scripts can vary based on operating system and whether applied locally or remotely.  \n\nAdversaries may use these scripts to maintain persistence on a single system. Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary. \n\nAn adversary may also be able to escalate their privileges since some boot or logon initialization scripts run with higher privileges.\nIs Subtechnique: False\nPlatforms: macOS, Windows, Linux, Network\nExternal URL: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037\n\nAttack technique name: RC Scripts\nDescription: Adversaries may establish persistence by modifying RC scripts which are executed during a Unix-like system’s startup. These files allow system administrators to map and start custom services at startup for different run levels. RC scripts require root privileges to modify.\n\nAdversaries can establish persistence by adding a malicious binary path or shell commands to <code>rc.local</code>, <code>rc.common</code>, and other RC scripts specific to the Unix-like distribution.(Citation: IranThreats Kittens Dec 2017)(Citation: Intezer HiddenWasp Map 2019) Upon reboot, the system executes the script's contents as root, resulting in persistence.\n\nAdversary abuse of RC scripts is especially effective for lightweight Unix-like distributions using the root user as default, such as IoT or embedded systems.(Citation: intezer-kaiji-malware)\n\nSeveral Unix-like systems have moved to Systemd and deprecated the use of RC scripts. This is now a deprecated mechanism in macOS in favor of [Launchd](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/004). (Citation: Apple Developer Doco Archive Launchd)(Citation: Startup Items) This technique can be used on Mac OS X Panther v10.3 and earlier versions which still execute the RC scripts.(Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence) To maintain backwards compatibility some systems, such as Ubuntu, will execute the RC scripts if they exist with the correct file permissions.(Citation: Ubuntu Manpage systemd rc)\nIs Subtechnique: True\nPlatforms: macOS, Linux, Network\nExternal URL: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/004\n\nAttack technique name: Logon Script (Windows)\nDescription: Adversaries may use Windows logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence. Windows allows logon scripts to be run whenever a specific user or group of users log into a system.(Citation: TechNet Logon Scripts) This is done via adding a path to a script to the <code>HKCU\\Environment\\UserInitMprLogonScript</code> Registry key.(Citation: Hexacorn Logon Scripts)\n\nAdversaries may use these scripts to maintain persistence on a single system. Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary. \nIs Subtechnique: True\nPlatforms: Windows\nExternal URL: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/001\n\nAttack technique name: Network Logon Script\nDescription: Adversaries may use network logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence. Network logon scripts can be assigned using Active Directory or Group Policy Objects.(Citation: Petri Logon Script AD) These logon scripts run with the privileges of the user they are assigned to. Depending on the systems within the network, initializing one of these scripts could apply to more than one or potentially all systems.  \n \nAdversaries may use these scripts to maintain persistence on a network. Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary.\nIs Subtechnique: True\nPlatforms: Windows\nExternal URL: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/003\n\nAttack technique name: Startup Items\nDescription: Adversaries may use startup items automatically executed at boot initialization to establish persistence. Startup items execute during the final phase of the boot process and contain shell scripts or other executable files along with configuration information used by the system to determine the execution order for all startup items.(Citation: Startup Items)\n\nThis is technically a deprecated technology (superseded by [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004)), and thus the appropriate folder, <code>/Library/StartupItems</code> isn’t guaranteed to exist on the system by default, but does appear to exist by default on macOS Sierra. A startup item is a directory whose executable and configuration property list (plist), <code>StartupParameters.plist</code>, reside in the top-level directory. \n\nAn adversary can create the appropriate folders/files in the StartupItems directory to register their own persistence mechanism.(Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence) Additionally, since StartupItems run during the bootup phase of macOS, they will run as the elevated root user.\nIs Subtechnique: True\nPlatforms: macOS\nExternal URL: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/005\n\nAttack technique name: Login Hook\nDescription: Adversaries may use a Login Hook to establish persistence executed upon\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BOOT OR LOGON INITIALIZATION SCRIPTS<|>EVENT<|>Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts is an attack technique where scripts are executed at boot or logon to establish persistence on a system.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RC SCRIPTS<|>EVENT<|>RC Scripts are a sub-technique of Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts, allowing adversaries to modify scripts executed during a Unix-like system's startup to maintain persistence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOGON SCRIPT (WINDOWS)<|>EVENT<|>Logon Script (Windows) is a sub-technique of Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts, where Windows logon scripts are executed at user logon to establish persistence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NETWORK LOGON SCRIPT<|>EVENT<|>Network Logon Script is a sub-technique of Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts, where scripts are executed at logon initialization across a network to maintain persistence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STARTUP ITEMS<|>EVENT<|>Startup Items is a sub-technique of Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts, where items are executed during the boot process to establish persistence on macOS.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOGIN HOOK<|>EVENT<|>Login Hook is a method used by adversaries to establish persistence executed upon user login on macOS.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOOT OR LOGON INITIALIZATION SCRIPTS<|>RC SCRIPTS<|>RC Scripts are a sub-technique of Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts, allowing for persistence through Unix-like system startup scripts.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOOT OR LOGON INITIALIZATION SCRIPTS<|>LOGON SCRIPT (WINDOWS)<|>Logon Script (Windows) is a sub-technique of Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts, enabling persistence at user logon on Windows systems.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOOT OR LOGON INITIALIZATION SCRIPTS<|>NETWORK LOGON SCRIPT<|>Network Logon Script is a sub-technique of Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts, allowing for persistence across a network during logon.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOOT OR LOGON INITIALIZATION SCRIPTS<|>STARTUP ITEMS<|>Startup Items are a sub-technique of Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts, executing during boot to establish persistence on macOS.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOOT OR LOGON INITIALIZATION SCRIPTS<|>LOGIN HOOK<|>Login Hook is a method under Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts, executed upon user login to maintain persistence on macOS.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
