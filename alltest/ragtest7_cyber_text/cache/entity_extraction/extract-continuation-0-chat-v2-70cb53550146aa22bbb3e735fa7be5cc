This may also enable follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002).\n\nDHCP is based on a client-server model and has two functionalities: a protocol for providing network configuration settings from a DHCP server to a client and a mechanism for allocating network addresses to clients.(Citation: rfc2131) The typical server-client interaction is as follows: \n\n1. The client broadcasts a `DISCOVER` message.\n\n2. The server responds with an `OFFER` message, which includes an available network address. \n\n3. The client broadcasts a `REQUEST` message, which includes the network address offered. \n\n4. The server acknowledges with an `ACK` message and the client receives the network configuration parameters.\n\nAdversaries may spoof as a rogue DHCP server on the victim network, from which legitimate hosts may receive malicious network configurations. For example, malware can act as a DHCP server and provide adversary-owned DNS servers to the victimized computers.(Citation: new_rogue_DHCP_serv_malware)(Citation: w32.tidserv.g) Through the malicious network configurations, an adversary may achieve the AiTM position, route client traffic through adversary-controlled systems, and collect information from the client network.\n\nDHCPv6 clients can receive network configuration information without being assigned an IP address by sending a <code>INFORMATION-REQUEST (code 11)</code> message to the <code>All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers</code> multicast address.(Citation: rfc3315) Adversaries may use their rogue DHCP server to respond to this request message with malicious network configurations.\n\nRather than establishing an AiTM position, adversaries may also abuse DHCP spoofing to perform a DHCP exhaustion attack (i.e, [Service Exhaustion Flood](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/002)) by generating many broadcast DISCOVER messages to exhaust a network’s DHCP allocation pool. \nPlatforms: Linux, Windows, macOS\n\nAttack technique name: LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay\nAttck technique description: By responding to LLMNR/NBT-NS network traffic, adversaries may spoof an authoritative source for name resolution to force communication with an adversary controlled system. This activity may be used to collect or relay authentication materials. \n\nLink-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) are Microsoft Windows components that serve as alternate methods of host identification. LLMNR is based upon the Domain Name System (DNS) format and allows hosts on the same local link to perform name resolution for other hosts. NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name. (Citation: Wikipedia LLMNR)(Citation: TechNet NetBIOS)\n\nAdversaries can spoof an authoritative source for name resolution on a victim network by responding to LLMNR (UDP 5355)/NBT-NS (UDP 137) traffic as if they know the identity of the requested host, effectively poisoning the service so that the victims will communicate with the adversary controlled system. If the requested host belongs to a resource that requires identification/authentication, the username and NTLMv2 hash will then be sent to the adversary controlled system. The adversary can then collect the hash information sent over the wire through tools that monitor the ports for traffic or through [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) and crack the hashes offline through [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110) to obtain the plaintext passwords.\n\nIn some cases where an adversary has access to a system that is in the authentication path between systems or when automated scans that use credentials attempt to authenticate to an adversary controlled system, the NTLMv1/v2 hashes can be intercepted and relayed to access and execute code against a target system. The relay step can happen in conjunction with poisoning but may also be independent of it.(Citation: byt3bl33d3r NTLM Relaying)(Citation: Secure Ideas SMB Relay) Additionally, adversaries may encapsulate the NTLMv1/v2 hashes into various protocols, such as LDAP, SMB, MSSQL and HTTP, to expand and use multiple services with the valid NTLM response. \n\nSeveral tools may be used to poison name services within local networks such as NBNSpoof, Metasploit, and [Responder](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0174).(Citation: GitHub NBNSpoof)(Citation: Rapid7 LLMNR Spoofer)(Citation: GitHub Responder)\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Socket Filters\nAttck technique description: Adversaries may attach filters to a network socket to monitor then activate backdoors used for persistence or command and control. With elevated permissions, adversaries can use features such as the `libpcap` library to open sockets and install filters to allow or disallow certain types of data to come through the socket. The filter may apply to all traffic passing through the specified network interface (or every interface if not specified). When the network interface receives a packet matching the filter criteria, additional actions can be triggered on the host, such as activation of a reverse shell.\n\nTo establish a connection, an adversary sends a crafted packet to the targeted host that matches the installed filter criteria.(Citation: haking9 libpcap network sniffing) Adversaries have used these socket filters to trigger the installation of implants, conduct ping backs, and to invoke command shells. Communication with these socket filters may also be used\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DHCP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DHCP is a protocol used for providing network configuration settings from a DHCP server to a client and allocating network addresses to clients.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LLMNR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) is a Microsoft Windows component that allows hosts on the same local link to perform name resolution for other hosts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NBT-NS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) is a Microsoft Windows component that identifies systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>GEO<|>Windows is an operating system developed by Microsoft that includes components like LLMNR and NBT-NS for network communication.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>GEO<|>Linux is an open-source operating system that can be used in various computing environments, including network configurations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>GEO<|>macOS is an operating system developed by Apple Inc. that is used on Macintosh computers and supports various network functionalities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>METASPLOIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Metasploit is a penetration testing framework that can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in systems, including poisoning name services.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESPONDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Responder is a tool used for network attacks that can poison name services within local networks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NBNSPOOF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NBNSpoof is a tool that can be used to spoof NetBIOS name service requests in local networks.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DHCP<|>WINDOWS<|>DHCP is a protocol that operates on Windows systems to provide network configuration settings.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LLMNR<|>WINDOWS<|>LLMNR is a component of the Windows operating system that allows for local name resolution.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NBT-NS<|>WINDOWS<|>NBT-NS is a service used in Windows for identifying systems on a local network.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>METASPLOIT<|>WINDOWS<|>Metasploit can be used on Windows systems to exploit vulnerabilities, including those related to network services.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RESPONDER<|>WINDOWS<|>Responder is a tool that can be used on Windows to perform network attacks, including name service poisoning.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NBNSPOOF<|>WINDOWS<|>NBNSpoof is a tool that operates on Windows to spoof NetBIOS name service requests.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LLMNR<|>NBT-NS<|>LLMNR and NBT-NS are both Microsoft Windows components used for name resolution on local networks.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
