Configure software on endpoints to filter network traffic.\nExternal URL: https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1037\n\nMitigation method name: Encrypt Sensitive Information\nDescription: Protect sensitive information with strong encryption.\nExternal URL: https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1041\n\nMitigation method name: Limit Access to Resource Over Network\nDescription: Prevent access to file shares, remote access to systems, unnecessary services. Mechanisms to limit access may include use of network concentrators, RDP gateways, etc.\nExternal URL: https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1035\n\nMitigation method name: Disable or Remove Feature or Program\nDescription: Remove or deny access to unnecessary and potentially vulnerable software to prevent abuse by adversaries.\nExternal URL: https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1042\n\nMitigation method name: User Training\nDescription: Train users to be aware of access or manipulation attempts by an adversary to reduce the risk of successful spearphishing, social engineering, and other techniques that involve user interaction.\nExternal URL: https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1017\n\nMitigation method name: Network Intrusion Prevention\nDescription: Use intrusion detection signatures to block traffic at network boundaries.\nExternal URL: https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1031\n\nMitigation method name: Network Segmentation\nDescription: Architect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use a DMZ to contain any internet-facing services that should not be exposed from the internal network. Configure separate virtual private cloud (VPC) instances to isolate critical cloud systems.\nExternal URL: https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1030\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
