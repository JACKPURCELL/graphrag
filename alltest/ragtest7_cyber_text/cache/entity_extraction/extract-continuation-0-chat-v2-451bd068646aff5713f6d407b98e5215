Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use a DMZ to contain any internet-facing services that should not be exposed from the internal network. Configure separate virtual private cloud (VPC) instances to isolate critical cloud systems.\n\nThis is a mitigation method called Filter Network Traffic, its information is as follows:\nDescription: Use network appliances to filter ingress or egress traffic and perform protocol-based filtering.
