This behavior is the same for logout hooks where a script can be executed upon user logout. All hooks require administrator permissions to modify or create hooks.(Citation: Login Scripts Apple Dev)(Citation: LoginWindowScripts Apple Dev) \n\nAdversaries can add or insert a path to a malicious script in the <code>com.apple.loginwindow.plist</code> file, using the <code>LoginHook</code> or <code>LogoutHook</code> key-value pair. The malicious script is executed upon the next user login. If a login hook already exists, adversaries can add additional commands to an existing login hook. There can be only one login and logout hook on a system at a time.(Citation: S1 macOs Persistence)(Citation: Wardle Persistence Chapter)\n\n**Note:** Login hooks were deprecated in 10.11 version of macOS in favor of [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004) and [Launch Agent](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/001) \nPlatforms: macOS\n\nAttack technique name: Socket Filters\nAttck technique description: Adversaries may attach filters to a network socket to monitor then activate backdoors used for persistence or command and control. With elevated permissions, adversaries can use features such as the `libpcap` library to open sockets and install filters to allow or disallow certain types of data to come through the socket. The filter may apply to all traffic passing through the specified network interface (or every interface if not specified). When the network interface receives a packet matching the filter criteria, additional actions can be triggered on the host, such as activation of a reverse shell.\n\nTo establish a connection, an adversary sends a crafted packet to the targeted host that matches the installed filter criteria.(Citation: haking9 libpcap network sniffing) Adversaries have used these socket filters to trigger the installation of implants, conduct ping backs, and to invoke command shells. Communication with these socket filters may also be used in conjunction with [Protocol Tunneling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572).(Citation: exatrack bpf filters passive backdoors)(Citation: Leonardo Turla Penquin May 2020)\n\nFilters can be installed on any Unix-like platform with `libpcap` installed or on Windows hosts using `Winpcap`.  Adversaries may use either `libpcap` with `pcap_setfilter` or the standard library function `setsockopt` with `SO_ATTACH_FILTER` options. Since the socket connection is not active until the packet is received, this behavior may be difficult to detect due to the lack of activity on a host, low CPU overhead, and limited visibility into raw socket usage.\nPlatforms: Linux, macOS, Windows\n\nAttack technique name: ARP Cache Poisoning\nAttck technique description: Adversaries may poison Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) caches to position themselves between the communication of two or more networked devices. This activity may be used to enable follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002).\n\nThe ARP protocol is used to resolve IPv4 addresses to link layer addresses, such as a media access control (MAC) address.(Citation: RFC826 ARP) Devices in a local network segment communicate with each other by using link layer addresses. If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address. The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address. The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.\n\nAn adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of the requesting device. The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device. For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner. Adversaries may also send a gratuitous ARP reply that maliciously announces the ownership of a particular IP address to all the devices in the local network segment.\n\nThe ARP protocol is stateless and does not require authentication. Therefore, devices may wrongly add or update the MAC address of the IP address in their ARP cache.(Citation: Sans ARP Spoofing Aug 2003)(Citation: Cylance Cleaver)\n\nAdversaries may use ARP cache poisoning as a means to intercept network traffic. This activity may be used to collect and/or relay data such as credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol.(Citation: Sans ARP Spoofing Aug 2003)\n\nPlatforms: Linux, Windows, macOS\n\nAttack technique name: Archive via Utility\nAttck technique description: Adversaries may use utilities to compress and/or encrypt collected data prior to exfiltration. Many utilities include functionalities to compress, encrypt, or otherwise package data into a format that is easier/more secure to transport.\n\nAdversaries may abuse various utilities to compress or encrypt data before exfiltration. Some third party utilities may be preinstalled, such as <code>tar</code> on Linux and macOS or <code>zip</code> on Windows systems. \n\nOn Windows, <code>diantz</code> or <code> makecab</code> may be used to package collected files into a cabinet (.cab) file. <code>diantz</code> may also be used to download and compress\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>GEO<|>macOS is an operating system developed by Apple Inc. for Macintosh computers, known for its user-friendly interface and robust security features.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>GEO<|>Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, widely used for servers and desktops.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>GEO<|>Windows is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families developed by Microsoft, known for its widespread use in personal computers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIBPCAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>libpcap is a system-independent interface for user-level packet capture, allowing the capture of network traffic on various platforms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINPCAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>WinPcap is a Windows port of the libpcap library, providing packet capture and network analysis capabilities for Windows applications.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARP CACHE POISONING<|>EVENT<|>ARP Cache Poisoning is a network attack technique where an adversary sends false ARP messages to associate their MAC address with the IP address of another device.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOCKET FILTERS<|>EVENT<|>Socket Filters are a technique used by adversaries to monitor and control network traffic by attaching filters to network sockets.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARCHIVE VIA UTILITY<|>EVENT<|>Archive via Utility is a technique where adversaries use compression or encryption utilities to package data for exfiltration.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MACOS<|>LIBPCAP<|>libpcap can be used on macOS to capture network traffic, making it relevant for security and monitoring purposes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINUX<|>LIBPCAP<|>libpcap is commonly used on Linux systems for packet capturing and network analysis<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINDOWS<|>WINPCAP<|>WinPcap is the Windows version of libpcap, used for packet capturing on Windows systems<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARP CACHE POISONING<|>LINUX<|>ARP Cache Poisoning can be executed on Linux systems to intercept network traffic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARP CACHE POISONING<|>WINDOWS<|>ARP Cache Poisoning can be executed on Windows systems to intercept network traffic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARP CACHE POISONING<|>MACOS<|>ARP Cache Poisoning can be executed on macOS systems to intercept network traffic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOCKET FILTERS<|>LINUX<|>Socket Filters can be implemented on Linux systems to monitor network traffic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOCKET FILTERS<|>WINDOWS<|>Socket Filters can be implemented on Windows systems to monitor network traffic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOCKET FILTERS<|>MACOS<|>Socket Filters can be implemented on macOS systems to monitor network traffic<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARCHIVE VIA UTILITY<|>LINUX<|>Utilities like tar are commonly used on Linux for archiving and compressing data<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARCHIVE VIA UTILITY<|>WINDOWS<|>Utilities like zip are commonly used on Windows for archiving and compressing data<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARCHIVE VIA UTILITY<|>MACOS<|>Utilities like tar are commonly used on macOS for archiving and compressing data<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
