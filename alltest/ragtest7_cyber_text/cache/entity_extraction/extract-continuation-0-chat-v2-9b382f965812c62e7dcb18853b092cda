This value causes Windows, at startup, to check the file-system integrity of the hard disks if the system has been shut down abnormally. Adversaries can add other programs or processes to this registry value which will automatically launch at boot.\n\nAdversaries can use these configuration locations to execute malware, such as remote access tools, to maintain persistence through system reboots.

The Windows security subsystem is a set of components that manage and enforce the security policy for a computer or domain. The Local Security Authority (LSA) is the main component responsible for local security policy and user authentication. The LSA includes multiple dynamic link libraries (DLLs) associated with various other security functions, all of which run in the context of the LSA Subsystem Service (LSASS) lsass.exe process.(Citation: Microsoft Security Subsystem)\n\nAdversaries may target LSASS drivers to obtain persistence. By either replacing or adding illegitimate drivers (e.g., [Hijack Execution Flow](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574)), an adversary can use LSA operations to continuously execute malicious payloads.\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Print Processors\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may abuse print processors to run malicious DLLs during system boot for persistence and/or privilege escalation. Print processors are DLLs that are loaded by the print spooler service, `spoolsv.exe`, during boot.(Citation: Microsoft Intro Print Processors)\n\nAdversaries may abuse the print spooler service by adding print processors that load malicious DLLs at startup. A print processor can be installed through the <code>AddPrintProcessor</code> API call with an account that has <code>SeLoadDriverPrivilege</code> enabled. Alternatively, a print processor can be registered to the print spooler service by adding the <code>HKLM\\SYSTEM\\\\[CurrentControlSet or ControlSet001]\\Control\\Print\\Environments\\\\[Windows architecture: e.g., Windows x64]\\Print Processors\\\\[user defined]\\Driver</code> Registry key that points to the DLL.\n\nFor the malicious print processor to be correctly installed, the payload must be located in the dedicated system print-processor directory, that can be found with the <code>GetPrintProcessorDirectory</code> API call, or referenced via a relative path from this directory.(Citation: Microsoft AddPrintProcessor May 2018) After the print processors are installed, the print spooler service, which starts during boot, must be restarted in order for them to run.(Citation: ESET PipeMon May 2020)\n\nThe print spooler service runs under SYSTEM level permissions, therefore print processors installed by an adversary may run under elevated privileges.\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Active Setup\nAttack\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>GEO<|>Windows is an operating system platform that supports various functionalities including startup programs and registry modifications for persistence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LSASS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) is a process in Windows responsible for enforcing security policies and user authentication.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPOLSV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The print spooler service (spoolsv.exe) in Windows manages print jobs and can be exploited to run malicious DLLs during system boot.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MALWARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Malware refers to malicious software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRINT PROCESSORS<|>EVENT<|>Print processors are DLLs loaded by the print spooler service during boot, which can be abused to run malicious code.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REGISTRY KEYS<|>EVENT<|>Registry keys in Windows are used to store configuration settings and can be manipulated to execute programs at startup.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADVERSARIES<|>PERSON<|>Adversaries are individuals or groups that exploit vulnerabilities in systems to execute malicious activities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOOTEXECUTE<|>EVENT<|>BootExecute is a registry value that controls the execution of programs at system startup, which can be modified by adversaries.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LSASS<|>WINDOWS<|>LSASS is a critical component of the Windows operating system responsible for local security policy and user authentication<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPOLSV<|>WINDOWS<|>The print spooler service is a part of the Windows operating system that manages print jobs<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MALWARE<|>ADVERSARIES<|>Adversaries create and deploy malware to exploit system vulnerabilities<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRINT PROCESSORS<|>SPOLSV<|>Print processors are loaded by the print spooler service during system boot<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REGISTRY KEYS<|>WINDOWS<|>Registry keys are integral to the configuration and operation of the Windows operating system<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOOTEXECUTE<|>WINDOWS<|>BootExecute is a registry value that affects the startup behavior of the Windows operating system<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADVERSARIES<|>MALWARE<|>Adversaries use malware to maintain persistence and exploit systems<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
