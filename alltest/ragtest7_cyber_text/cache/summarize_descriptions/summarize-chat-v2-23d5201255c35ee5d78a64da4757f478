{"result": "The term \"REJECTED\" refers to a specific state assigned to various Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) entries, indicating that these entries are no longer considered valid for use or publication. This status applies to multiple CVEs, each with distinct reasons for rejection. \n\nFor instance, CVE-1999-0110 was rejected due to a typo in its description, while CVE-1999-1056 was marked as a duplicate and therefore not accepted. Similarly, CVE-1999-1310 and CVE-1999-0335 were both rejected, indicating they are no longer valid for use. Other entries, such as CVE-1999-0531, CVE-1999-0642, and CVE-1999-0645, were not accepted for publication due to their nature, which did not meet the criteria for valid vulnerabilities.\n\nSeveral CVEs, including CVE-1999-0615, CVE-1999-0643, CVE-1999-0633, CVE-1999-0649, CVE-1999-0647, CVE-1999-0658, CVE-1999-1108, CVE-1999-0617, CVE-1999-0614, CVE-1999-0623, CVE-1999-0634, CVE-1999-0646, CVE-1999-0648, and CVE-1999-0659, were rejected primarily because they did not introduce direct security vulnerabilities or were classified as configuration issues rather than actual vulnerabilities.\n\nIn summary, the \"REJECTED\" state signifies that these CVE entries have been deemed invalid for various reasons, including typographical errors, duplication, or their nature not constituting a valid security vulnerability.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
