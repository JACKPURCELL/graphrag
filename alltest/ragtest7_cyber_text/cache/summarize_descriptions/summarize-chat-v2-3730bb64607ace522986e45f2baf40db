{"result": "FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol utilized for transferring files from one host to another over a TCP-based network. It is commonly referenced in various contexts, including the FreeBSD advisory for downloading patches. However, FTP has been associated with security vulnerabilities; it has been exploited due to insecure configurations, particularly noted in AIX systems. Additionally, FTP has been involved in specific attacks, such as the Pizza Thief attack, highlighting its potential risks when not properly secured.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
