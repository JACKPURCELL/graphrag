{"result": "KEYBOY refers to both an organization and a malware tool associated with cybersecurity and cyber attacks. On one hand, KEYBOY is described as an organization that develops software specifically for cybersecurity purposes. On the other hand, KeyBoy is identified as a malware tool utilized in cyber attacks, with ongoing updates and analyses regarding its functionalities and impacts. This malware is linked to the Tropic Trooper cyber threat group and has been employed in targeted campaigns, notably against members of the Tibetan Parliament in 2016.
