{"result": "Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) is a standardized method and system for identifying and describing system configurations that may introduce or lead to security vulnerabilities. It serves as a framework for recognizing and naming configuration issues in both software and hardware, thereby helping to pinpoint potential security risks associated with various system configurations. CCE aims to enhance the understanding of security configuration issues, facilitating better management and mitigation of vulnerabilities in systems.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
