{"result": "CVE, or the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures organization, is the overarching entity responsible for managing CVE records. It ensures that these records are updated and published, providing a standardized framework for identifying vulnerabilities. The CVE organization plays a crucial role in documenting specific vulnerabilities within its database.\n\nCVE_RECORD refers to a specific entry within the CVE database that identifies a particular vulnerability or exposure. Each CVE_RECORD represents a unique instance of a vulnerability, serving as a documented reference for known vulnerabilities.
