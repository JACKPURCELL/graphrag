{"result": "Network Segmentation is a mitigation strategy that involves architecting sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. This approach utilizes both physical and logical segmentation to enhance security by preventing unauthorized access to sensitive systems and information. By effectively isolating these critical components, Network Segmentation helps to safeguard sensitive data and maintain the integrity of essential functions within the network.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
