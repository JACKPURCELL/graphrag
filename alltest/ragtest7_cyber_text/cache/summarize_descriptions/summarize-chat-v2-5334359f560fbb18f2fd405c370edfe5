{"result": "Ngrok is a legitimate reverse proxy tool that creates secure tunnels to servers located behind firewalls or on local machines. While it is primarily designed for legitimate purposes, it has also been utilized by threat actors for lateral movement and data exfiltration. Additionally, Ngrok is employed in conjunction with the Doki backdoor, which facilitates access to Docker servers in cloud platforms. This dual usage highlights both the tool's legitimate applications and its potential for misuse in cyber activities.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
