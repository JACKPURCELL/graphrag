{"result": "DATA_TYPE refers to the classification of the CVE_RECORD, indicating the type of data it contains and its structure and purpose within data management. It categorizes the information contained within the CVE record, which is specifically a record of a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) entry. The classification encompasses the format and nature of the information being processed or stored, ensuring that the data type accurately reflects the type of information represented in the CVE record. Ultimately, DATA_TYPE serves to categorize the CVE record as a CVE_RECORD, providing clarity on the structure and type of information it holds.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
