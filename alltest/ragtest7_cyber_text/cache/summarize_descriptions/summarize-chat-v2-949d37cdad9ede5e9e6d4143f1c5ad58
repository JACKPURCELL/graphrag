{"result": "Filter Network Traffic is a mitigation method that employs network appliances to filter both incoming (ingress) and outgoing (egress) traffic. This process enhances security by performing protocol-based filtering, which involves analyzing and controlling the types of protocols that can be used for network communications. Additionally, it may include configuring software on endpoints to further filter network traffic. Overall, Filter Network Traffic serves as a crucial strategy for securing network communications by ensuring that only authorized traffic is allowed through the network.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
