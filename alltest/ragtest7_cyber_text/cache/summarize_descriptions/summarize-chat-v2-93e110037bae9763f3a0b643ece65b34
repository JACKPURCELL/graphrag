{"result": "Oracle Webserver, specifically version 2.1 and earlier, is a web server software that operates with setuid root permissions. This configuration poses a security risk, as it allows potential privilege escalation for attackers who manage to gain access to the oracle account. Additionally, Oracle Webserver 2.1 facilitates the remote execution of PL/SQL stored procedures, which can be exploited. Furthermore, it is susceptible to denial of service attacks, particularly through the use of excessively long HTTP GET requests.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
