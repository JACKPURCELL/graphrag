This method of attack is characterized by its ability to overwhelm the target's resources, rendering it unable to respond to legitimate requests. Notably, DDoS attacks were initially associated with the BlackEnergy malware, which was specifically designed to execute such attacks.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
