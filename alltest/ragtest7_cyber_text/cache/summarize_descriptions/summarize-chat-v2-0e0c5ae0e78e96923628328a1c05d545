{"result": "CrackMapExec, commonly referred to as CME, is a post-exploitation tool developed in Python specifically for penetration testing against networks. Its primary function is to collect Active Directory information, which facilitates lateral movement within targeted networks. This tool is designed to assist security professionals in assessing the security posture of networks by enabling them to gather critical information that can be exploited during penetration testing activities.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
