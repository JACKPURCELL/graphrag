{"result": "Black Basta is a cybercriminal group that has been active since at least 2022, primarily known for its ransomware attacks. This group utilizes a ransomware strain that exploits vulnerabilities in Windows Management Instrumentation. Black Basta's ransomware is written in C++ and operates under a ransomware-as-a-service model, which allows other criminals to use their tools for a fee.
