{"result": "ARP Cache Poisoning is a sub-attack technique of Adversary-in-the-Middle that involves the manipulation of Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) caches. This technique is executed by sending false ARP messages within a local area network, which associates the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another host. As a result, adversaries can intercept network traffic between devices, allowing them to eavesdrop on communications or potentially alter the data being transmitted. Overall, ARP Cache Poisoning is a method used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information by exploiting the ARP protocol.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
