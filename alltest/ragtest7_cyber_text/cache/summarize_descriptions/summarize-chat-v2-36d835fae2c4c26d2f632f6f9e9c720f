{"result": "Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing tool that simulates advanced threats and is primarily used for red teaming. It functions as a remote access tool designed for adversary simulation and executing targeted attacks, effectively emulating the post-exploitation actions of advanced threat actors. Cobalt Strike leverages the capabilities of other tools, such as Metasploit and Mimikatz, to enhance its functionality in executing a range of post-exploitation actions. The tool has been delivered by DarkTortilla, emphasizing its role in the penetration testing landscape.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
