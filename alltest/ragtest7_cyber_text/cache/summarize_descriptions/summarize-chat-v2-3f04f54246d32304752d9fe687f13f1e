It comprises an installer, launcher, and backdoor components, allowing for unauthorized access to targeted systems. This software employs the Fileless Storage attack technique, which enables it to operate without leaving traditional traces on the file system, making detection more challenging. Additionally, Mosquito leverages Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to facilitate its cyber attacks, further enhancing its capabilities in executing malicious activities within compromised environments.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
