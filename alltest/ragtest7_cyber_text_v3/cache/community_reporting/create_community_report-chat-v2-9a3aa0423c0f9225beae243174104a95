By enabling attackers to replace SSH binaries or modify shared libraries used by OpenSSH, Ebury can effectively compromise the security of affected systems. The requirement for root-level access further amplifies its potential for damage, as it allows for deep infiltration into system operations. This targeting of Linux systems is critical, as many servers and enterprise environments rely on Linux, making them vulnerable to such attacks.
