Webshell is a powerful PHP webshell that has been in use since at least 2016, providing remote access and execution capabilities on target web servers. Its functionality across multiple platforms, including Windows and Linux, makes it a versatile tool for attackers. The webshell's ability to facilitate unauthorized access to web servers poses a significant risk to organizations that may be unaware of its presence. This is particularly concerning given its long-standing use, which suggests that it has been refined over time to evade detection and improve its effectiveness.
