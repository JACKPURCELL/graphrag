{"result": "CrackMapExec, commonly referred to as CME, is a post-exploitation tool developed in Python specifically for penetration testing against networks. Its primary function is to collect Active Directory information, which facilitates lateral movement within targeted networks. Over time, CrackMapExec has evolved to integrate various protocols, including FTP, Telnet, RDP, SSH, and SNMP, enhancing its capabilities for automating tasks and exploiting vulnerabilities in network systems. Initially focused on protocols such as SMB, WinRM, and WMI, the tool has shifted its emphasis to a broader range of protocols to improve vulnerability exploitation. Overall, CrackMapExec serves as a comprehensive security testing tool that aids penetration testers in assessing and exploiting network vulnerabilities effectively.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
