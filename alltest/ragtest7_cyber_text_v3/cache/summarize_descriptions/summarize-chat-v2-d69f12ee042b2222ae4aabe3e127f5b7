{"result": "Kernel Modules and Extensions refer to techniques that can be exploited in cyberattacks, highlighting the need for effective mitigation methods. This attack technique involves adversaries modifying the kernel to enable the automatic execution of programs during system boot. This is achieved through the use of Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs) or kernel extensions (kexts) specifically in macOS environments. The potential for exploitation underscores the importance of implementing robust security measures to protect against such vulnerabilities.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
