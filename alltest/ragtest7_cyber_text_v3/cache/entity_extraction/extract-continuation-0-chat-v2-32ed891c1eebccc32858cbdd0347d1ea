Remote services such as VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms allow users to connect to internal enterprise network resources from external locations. There are often remote service gateways that manage connections and credential authentication for these services. Services such as [Windows Remote Management](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/006) and [VNC](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/005) can also be used externally.(Citation: MacOS VNC software for Remote Desktop)\n\nAccess to [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to use the service is often a requirement, which could be obtained through credential pharming or by obtaining the credentials from users after compromising the enterprise network.(Citation: Volexity Virtual Private Keylogging) Access to remote services may be used as a redundant or persistent access mechanism during an operation.\n\nAccess may also be gained through an exposed service that doesn’t require authentication. In containerized environments, this may include an exposed Docker API, Kubernetes API server, kubelet, or web application such as the Kubernetes dashboard.(Citation: Trend Micro Exposed Docker Server)(Citation: Unit 42 Hildegard Malware)\nPlatforms: Windows, Linux, Containers, macOS\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EXTERNAL REMOTE SERVICES<|>EVENT<|>External Remote Services is an attack technique that allows adversaries to access and persist within a network through external-facing remote services like VPNs and Citrix.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS REMOTE MANAGEMENT<|>EVENT<|>Windows Remote Management is a service that can be used externally as part of the External Remote Services attack technique.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VNC<|>EVENT<|>VNC is a remote access software that can be utilized externally in the context of the External Remote Services attack technique.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VALID ACCOUNTS<|>EVENT<|>Valid Accounts are necessary for using remote services, often obtained through credential pharming or after compromising the enterprise network.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOCKER API<|>EVENT<|>The Docker API can be exposed in containerized environments, allowing access that may not require authentication.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KUBERNETES API SERVER<|>EVENT<|>The Kubernetes API server can be exposed in containerized environments, providing access that may not require authentication.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KUBELET<|>EVENT<|>Kubelet is a component in Kubernetes that can be exposed, allowing access that may not require authentication.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KUBERNETES DASHBOARD<|>EVENT<|>The Kubernetes dashboard is a web application that can be exposed, allowing access that may not require authentication.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>GEO<|>Linux is one of the platforms that can be targeted by the External Remote Services attack technique.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONTAINERS<|>GEO<|>Containers are environments that can be targeted by the External Remote Services attack technique.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>GEO<|>macOS is one of the platforms that can be targeted by the External Remote Services attack technique.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>GEO<|>Windows is one of the platforms that can be targeted by the External Remote Services attack technique.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXTERNAL REMOTE SERVICES<|>VALID ACCOUNTS<|>Valid Accounts are often required to use External Remote Services, indicating a dependency<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXTERNAL REMOTE SERVICES<|>WINDOWS REMOTE MANAGEMENT<|>Windows Remote Management is a service that can be used as part of the External Remote Services attack technique<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXTERNAL REMOTE SERVICES<|>VNC<|>VNC is a remote access software that can be utilized as part of the External Remote Services attack technique<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXTERNAL REMOTE SERVICES<|>DOCKER API<|>The Docker API can be exposed as part of the External Remote Services attack technique<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXTERNAL REMOTE SERVICES<|>KUBERNETES API SERVER<|>The Kubernetes API server can be exposed as part of the External Remote Services attack technique<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXTERNAL REMOTE SERVICES<|>KUBELET<|>Kubelet can be exposed as part of the External Remote Services attack technique<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXTERNAL REMOTE SERVICES<|>KUBERNETES DASHBOARD<|>The Kubernetes dashboard can be exposed as part of the External Remote Services attack technique<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXTERNAL REMOTE SERVICES<|>LINUX<|>Linux is a platform that can be targeted by the External Remote Services attack technique<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXTERNAL REMOTE SERVICES<|>CONTAINERS<|>Containers are environments that can be targeted by the External Remote Services attack technique<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXTERNAL REMOTE SERVICES<|>MACOS<|>macOS is a platform that can be targeted by the External Remote Services attack technique<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXTERNAL REMOTE SERVICES<|>WINDOWS<|>Windows is a platform that can be targeted by the External Remote Services attack technique<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
