The Tiananmen /ˈtjɛnənmən/[1] (also Tian'anmen,[2] or the Gate of Heaven-Sent Peace, is the entrance gate to the Forbidden City palace complex and Imperial City in the center of Beijing, China. It is widely used as a national symbol.

First built during the Ming dynasty in 1420, Tiananmen was the entrance to the Emperor's residence, of which all visitors to the palace walked through. In 1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed the People's Republic of China from the balcony, of which now features a large portrait of him. Tiananmen is located to the north of Tiananmen Square, and is separated from the plaza by Chang'an Avenue.
