It was the residence of 24 Ming and Qing dynasty Emperors, and the center of political power in China for over 500 years from 1420 to 1924. The palace is now administered by the Palace Museum. As a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the world. The Forbidden City is arguably the most famous palace in all of Chinese history, and is the largest preserved royal palace complex still standing in the world.\n\nThe Forbidden City was constructed from 1406 to 1420, and was the imperial palace and winter residence of the Emperor of China from the Ming dynasty (since the Yongle Emperor) to the end of the Qing dynasty, between 1420 and 1924. The Forbidden City served as the home of Chinese emperors and their households and was the ceremonial and political center of the Chinese government for over 500 years. Since 1925, the Forbidden City has been under the charge of the Palace Museum, whose extensive collection of artwork and artifacts was built upon the imperial collections of the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Forbidden City was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987.[2]\n\nThe complex claims to consist of 9,999 rooms in total, although experts have shown in recent years that the number only amounts to 8,886,[3] covering 72 ha (720,000 m2)/178-acre.[4][5] The palace exemplifies the opulence of the residences of the Chinese emperor and the traditional Chinese palatial architecture,[2] and has influenced cultural and architectural developments in East Asia and elsewhere. It is listed by UNESCO as the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the world. Since 2012, the Forbidden City has seen an average of 14 million visitors annually, and received more than 19 million visitors in 2019.[6] In 2018, the Forbidden City's market value was estimated at US$70 billion, making it both the world's most valuable palace and the most valuable piece of real estate anywhere in the world.[7]\n\nIt was listed as the first batch of national key cultural relics in 1961.[8] The palace is extremely important to the Chinese public and nation, who often view it as a cultural and heavenly link to their ancestors.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FORBIDDEN CITY<|>GEO<|>The Forbidden City is the imperial palace complex located in the center of the Imperial City in Beijing, China, serving as the residence of 24 Ming and Qing dynasty Emperors and the center of political power in China for over 500 years.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEIJING<|>GEO<|>Beijing is the capital city of China, where the Forbidden City is located.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PALACE MUSEUM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Palace Museum administers the Forbidden City and houses an extensive collection of artwork and artifacts from the Ming and Qing dynasties.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WANG XUDONG<|>PERSON<|>Wang Xudong is the curator of the Palace Museum, overseeing the collections and exhibitions related to the Forbidden City.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MING DYNASTY<|>EVENT<|>The Ming dynasty was a major Chinese dynasty that ruled from 1368 to 1644, during which the Forbidden City was constructed and served as the imperial palace.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QING DYNASTY<|>EVENT<|>The Qing dynasty was the last imperial dynasty of China, ruling from 1644 to 1912, during which the Forbidden City continued to serve as the imperial palace.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FORBIDDEN CITY<|>BEIJING<|>The Forbidden City is located in Beijing, serving as a significant historical and cultural site within the city<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FORBIDDEN CITY<|>PALACE MUSEUM<|>The Palace Museum administers the Forbidden City and is responsible for its preservation and public exhibitions<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WANG XUDONG<|>PALACE MUSEUM<|>Wang Xudong is the curator of the Palace Museum, directly overseeing the operations related to the Forbidden City<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FORBIDDEN CITY<|>MING DYNASTY<|>The Forbidden City was constructed during the Ming dynasty and served as the imperial palace<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FORBIDDEN CITY<|>QING DYNASTY<|>The Forbidden City served as the imperial palace during the Qing dynasty, continuing its role as the center of political power<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
