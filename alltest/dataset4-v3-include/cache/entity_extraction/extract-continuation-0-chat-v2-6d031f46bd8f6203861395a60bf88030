French: La Liberté éclairant le monde) is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, within New York City. The copper-clad statue, a gift to the United States from the people of France, was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and its metal framework was built by Gustave Eiffel. The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886.\n\nThe statue is a figure of a classically draped woman,[8] likely inspired by the Roman goddess of liberty Libertas.[9] In a contrapposto pose,[8][10] she holds a torch above her head with her right hand, and in her left hand carries a tabula ansata inscribed JULY IV MDCCLXXVI (July 4, 1776, in Roman numerals), the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. With her left foot she steps on a broken chain and shackle,[8] commemorating the national abolition of slavery following the American Civil War.[11][12][13] After its dedication the statue became an icon of freedom and of the United States, being subsequently seen as a symbol of welcome to immigrants arriving by sea.\n\nThe idea for the statue was conceived in 1865, when the French historian and abolitionist Édouard de Laboulaye proposed a monument to commemorate the upcoming centennial of U.S. independence (1876), the perseverance of American democracy and the liberation of the nation's slaves.[14] The Franco-Prussian War delayed progress until 1875, when Laboulaye proposed that the people of France finance the statue and the United States provide the site and build the pedestal. Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed, and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions.\n\nThe torch-bearing arm was displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, and in Madison Square Park in Manhattan from 1876 to 1882. Fundraising proved difficult, especially for the Americans, and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds. Publisher Joseph Pulitzer, of the New York World, started a drive for donations to finish the project and attracted more than 120,000 contributors, most of whom gave less than a dollar (equivalent to $34 in 2023). The statue was built in France, shipped overseas in crates, and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe's Island. The statue's completion was marked by New York's first ticker-tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland.\n\nThe statue was administered by the United States Lighthouse Board until 1901 and then by the Department of War; since 1933, it has been maintained by the National Park Service as part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument, and is a major tourist attraction. Limited numbers of visitors can access the rim of the pedestal and the interior of the statue's crown from within; public access to the torch has been barred since 1916.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STATUE OF LIBERTY<|>EVENT<|>The Statue of Liberty is a colossal neoclassical sculpture located on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, dedicated on October 28, 1886, symbolizing freedom and welcoming immigrants to the United States.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIBERTY ISLAND<|>GEO<|>Liberty Island is the location of the Statue of Liberty, situated in New York Harbor.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>GEO<|>New York City is the metropolitan area where Liberty Island and the Statue of Liberty are located.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREDERIC AUGUSTE BARTHOLDI<|>PERSON<|>Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi was the French sculptor who designed the Statue of Liberty.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUSTAVE EIFFEL<|>PERSON<|>Gustave Eiffel was the engineer responsible for the metal framework of the Statue of Liberty.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ÉDOUARD DE LABOULAYE<|>PERSON<|>Édouard de Laboulaye was a French historian and abolitionist who conceived the idea for the Statue of Liberty.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOSEPH PULITZER<|>PERSON<|>Joseph Pulitzer was a publisher who initiated a fundraising campaign to complete the pedestal for the Statue of Liberty.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FREDERIC AUGUSTE BARTHOLDI<|>STATUE OF LIBERTY<|>Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi designed the Statue of Liberty<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUSTAVE EIFFEL<|>STATUE OF LIBERTY<|>Gustave Eiffel built the metal framework for the Statue of Liberty<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ÉDOUARD DE LABOULAYE<|>STATUE OF LIBERTY<|>Édouard de Laboulaye proposed the idea for the Statue of Liberty<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOSEPH PULITZER<|>STATUE OF LIBERTY<|>Joseph Pulitzer led a fundraising campaign to complete the pedestal for the Statue of Liberty<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LIBERTY ISLAND<|>STATUE OF LIBERTY<|>The Statue of Liberty is located on Liberty Island<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>STATUE OF LIBERTY<|>The Statue of Liberty is a major landmark in New York City<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
