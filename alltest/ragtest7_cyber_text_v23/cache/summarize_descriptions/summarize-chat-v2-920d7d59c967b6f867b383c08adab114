{"result": "Serverless refers to a cloud-computing model that enables users to run applications without the need to manage servers directly. In this model, the cloud provider dynamically allocates machine resources, which can be advantageous for developers but also poses security risks, as it can be exploited by adversaries. The serverless infrastructure is often utilized by malicious actors to obscure their operations, making it challenging to detect and mitigate threats. Consequently, serverless is recognized as an attack technique that necessitates specific mitigation methods to prevent initial access by adversaries.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
