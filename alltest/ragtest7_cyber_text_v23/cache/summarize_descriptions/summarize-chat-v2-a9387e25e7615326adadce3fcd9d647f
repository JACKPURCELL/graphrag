{"result": "Code Signing is a mitigation method that enforces binary and application integrity through digital signature verification. This process is designed to prevent the execution of untrusted code, ensuring that only verified and trusted applications can run. By utilizing digital signatures, Code Signing helps maintain the security and integrity of software, protecting users from potential threats associated with unverified code.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
