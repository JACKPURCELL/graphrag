Maze, discovered in May 2019, is known for encrypting files on victim machines and conducting information-stealing campaigns prior to encryption. Ragnar Locker has been in use since at least December 2019 and operates similarly. The relationship between these two ransomware types indicates a broader trend in the evolution of cyber threats, where multiple ransomware variants are deployed to exploit vulnerabilities in systems.
