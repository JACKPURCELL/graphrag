In this model, the cloud provider dynamically allocates machine resources, which can be advantageous for developers but also poses security risks, as it can be exploited by adversaries. The serverless infrastructure is often utilized by malicious actors to obscure their operations, making it challenging to detect and mitigate threats. Consequently, serverless is recognized as an attack technique that necessitates specific mitigation methods to prevent initial access by adversaries.\",4\n937,ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE,\"\"\"ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE\"\" refers to an attack technique employed by adversaries to enhance their operational capabilities. This technique involves the acquisition of various types of infrastructure, which may include purchasing, leasing, renting, or otherwise obtaining resources necessary for targeting operations. Such resources can encompass physical or cloud servers, domain names, and third-party web services, enabling attackers to effectively execute their malicious activities.\",10\n601,BOTNET,\"A botnet is a network of compromised systems, specifically private computers infected with malicious software, which are controlled as a group without the knowledge of their owners. This network can be utilized for coordinated malicious activities, including phishing and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The botnet serves as an attack technique that enables the execution of various cyber attacks, such as launching attacks or stealing data, by leveraging the collective power of the infected devices.\",7\n1114,VIRTUAL PRIVATE SERVER,\"A Virtual Private Server (VPS) is a virtualized server that functions similarly to a dedicated server, although it operates on a shared server infrastructure. VPSs are commonly utilized by adversaries for hosting operations, making them a significant concern in cybersecurity. This attack technique necessitates the implementation of effective mitigation methods to prevent adversaries from gaining initial access to systems. Additionally, Virtual Private Servers are cloud-based solutions that can be rented for a variety of online activities, offering users a degree of anonymity. Overall, VPSs serve dual purposes, being valuable tools for legitimate online activities while also posing risks when exploited by malicious actors.\",4\n1190,DNS SERVER,\"The DNS Server is a critical component of the internet infrastructure that translates domain names into IP addresses, enabling users to access websites and services using easily memorable names rather than numerical addresses. However, DNS Servers can be vulnerable to manipulation by adversaries, who may exploit this functionality for malicious purposes, including command and control operations. To mitigate these risks, various pre-compromise activities and security measures can be implemented to protect DNS Servers from potential attacks.\",3\n694,MALVERTISING,\"Malvertising is an attack technique employed by adversaries who purchase online advertisements to distribute malware to unsuspecting victims. This method often involves impersonating well-known brands to deceive users into clicking on malicious ads, thereby facilitating the spread of malware.\",3\n643,SERVER,\"The term \"\"SERVER\"\" refers to a system that provides data, resources, or services to other computers.
