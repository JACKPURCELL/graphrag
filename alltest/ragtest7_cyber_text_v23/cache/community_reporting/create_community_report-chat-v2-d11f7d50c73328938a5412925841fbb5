This method involves the deliberate concealment of artifacts linked to malicious behaviors, allowing adversaries to evade detection by security measures. The effectiveness of this technique is underscored by its connections to other evasion methods, indicating a comprehensive strategy for maintaining stealth. The relationships with other techniques such as Ignore Process Interrupts and Masquerade Task or Service highlight its central role in adversarial tactics.
