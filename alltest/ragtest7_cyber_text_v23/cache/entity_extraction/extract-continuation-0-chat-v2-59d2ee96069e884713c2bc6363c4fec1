This value causes Windows, at startup, to check the file-system integrity of the hard disks if the system has been shut down abnormally. Adversaries can add other programs or processes to this registry value which will automatically launch at boot.\n\nAdversaries can use these configuration locations to execute malware, such as remote access tools, to maintain persistence through system reboots. Adversaries may also use [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036) to make the Registry entries look as if they are associated with legitimate programs.\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: LSASS Driver\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may modify or add LSASS drivers to obtain persistence on compromised systems. The Windows security subsystem is a set of components that manage and enforce the security policy for a computer or domain. The Local Security Authority (LSA) is the main component responsible for local security policy and user authentication. The LSA includes multiple dynamic link libraries (DLLs) associated with various other security functions, all of which run in the context of the LSA Subsystem Service (LSASS) lsass.exe process.(Citation: Microsoft Security Subsystem)\n\nAdversaries may target LSASS drivers to obtain persistence. By either replacing or adding illegitimate drivers (e.g., [Hijack Execution Flow](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574)), an adversary can use LSA operations to continuously execute malicious payloads.\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Print Processors\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may abuse print processors to run malicious DLLs during system boot for persistence and/or privilege escalation. Print processors are DLLs that are loaded by the print spooler service, `spoolsv.exe`, during boot.(Citation: Microsoft Intro Print Processors)\n\nAdversaries may abuse the print spooler service by adding print processors that load malicious DLLs at startup. A print processor can be installed through the <code>AddPrintProcessor</code> API call with an account that has <code>SeLoadDriverPrivilege</code> enabled. Alternatively, a print processor can be registered to the print spooler service by adding the <code>HKLM\\SYSTEM\\\\[CurrentControlSet or ControlSet001]\\Control\\Print\\Environments\\\\[Windows architecture: e.g., Windows x64]\\Print Processors\\\\[user defined]\\Driver</code> Registry key that points to the DLL.\n\nFor the malicious print processor to be correctly installed, the payload must be located in the dedicated system print-processor directory, that can be found with the <code>GetPrintProcessorDirectory</code> API call, or referenced via a relative path from this directory.(Citation: Microsoft AddPrintProcessor May 2018) After the print processors are installed, the print spooler service, which starts during boot, must be restarted in order for them to run.(Citation: ESET PipeMon May 2020)\n\nThe print spooler service runs under SYSTEM level permissions, therefore print processors installed by an adversary may run under elevated privileges.\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Active Setup\nAttack\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>GEO<|>Windows is an operating system developed by Microsoft, widely used for personal computers and servers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft is a multinational technology company that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports, and sells computer software, consumer electronics, and personal computers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LSASS<|>EVENT<|>LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) is a process in Windows that enforces the security policy on the system and handles user authentication.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPOLSV.EXE<|>EVENT<|>Spoolsv.exe is the executable for the print spooler service in Windows, responsible for managing print jobs and print processors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE is a registry hive in Windows that contains configuration information for the local computer.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HKEY_CURRENT_USER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HKEY_CURRENT_USER is a registry hive in Windows that contains configuration information for the user currently logged into the system.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOOTEXECUTE<|>EVENT<|>BootExecute is a registry value that determines what programs are executed during the boot process in Windows.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRINT PROCESSORS<|>EVENT<|>Print processors are dynamic link libraries (DLLs) that are loaded by the print spooler service during system boot to manage print jobs.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>WINDOWS<|>Microsoft is the developer of the Windows operating system, which is widely used across various devices.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LSASS<|>WINDOWS<|>LSASS is a critical component of the Windows operating system responsible for enforcing security policies and user authentication.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPOLSV.EXE<|>WINDOWS<|>Spoolsv.exe is a service that runs within the Windows operating system to manage print jobs and print processors.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE<|>WINDOWS<|>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE is a registry hive that contains system-wide settings for the Windows operating system.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HKEY_CURRENT_USER<|>WINDOWS<|>HKEY_CURRENT_USER is a registry hive that contains user-specific settings for the Windows operating system.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOOTEXECUTE<|>WINDOWS<|>BootExecute is a registry value that is part of the Windows operating system's boot process, determining which programs run at startup.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRINT PROCESSORS<|>WINDOWS<|>Print processors are part of the Windows operating system's printing architecture, loaded during boot to manage print jobs.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
