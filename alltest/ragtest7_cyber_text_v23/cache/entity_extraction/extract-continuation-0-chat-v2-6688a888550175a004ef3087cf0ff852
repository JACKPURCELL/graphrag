Their names are as follows:\n* Security Account Manager\n* LSA Secrets\n* DCSync\n* Proc Filesystem\n* NTDS\n* Cached Domain Credentials\n* LSASS Memory\n* /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow\n\nThe following content describes information about the attack techniques. The format of each attack technique's information is as follows:\nAttack technique name: ***\nAttack technique description: ***\nPlatforms: ***\nThese respectively represent the name of the attack technique, a detailed description, and the platforms it can target.\n\nAttack technique name: OS Credential Dumping\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may attempt to dump credentials to obtain account login and credential material, normally in the form of a hash or a clear text password. Credentials can be obtained from OS caches, memory, or structures.(Citation: Brining MimiKatz to Unix) Credentials can then be used to perform [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008) and access restricted information.\n\nSeveral of the tools mentioned in associated sub-techniques may be used by both adversaries and professional security testers. Additional custom tools likely exist as well.\n\nPlatforms: Windows, Linux, macOS\n\nAttack technique name: Security Account Manager\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may attempt to extract credential material from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database either through in-memory techniques or through the Windows Registry where the SAM database is stored. The SAM is a database file that contains local accounts for the host, typically those found with the <code>net user</code> command. Enumerating the SAM database requires SYSTEM level access.\n\nA number of tools can be used to retrieve the SAM file through in-memory techniques:\n\n* pwdumpx.exe\n* [gsecdump](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0008)\n* [Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002)\n* secretsdump.py\n\nAlternatively, the SAM can be extracted from the Registry with Reg:\n\n* <code>reg save HKLM\\sam sam</code>\n* <code>reg save HKLM\\system system</code>\n\nCreddump7 can then be used to process the SAM database locally to retrieve hashes.(Citation: GitHub Creddump7)\n\nNotes: \n\n* RID 500 account is the local, built-in administrator.\n* RID 501 is the guest account.\n* User accounts start with a RID of 1,000+.\n\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: LSA Secrets\nAttack technique description: Adversaries with SYSTEM access to a host may attempt to access Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets, which can contain a variety of different credential materials, such as credentials for service accounts.(Citation: Passcape LSA Secrets)(Citation: Microsoft AD Admin Tier Model)(Citation: Tilbury Windows Credentials) LSA secrets are stored in the registry at <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SECURITY\\Policy\\Secrets</code>. LSA secrets can also be dumped from memory.(Citation: ired Dumping LSA Secrets)\n\n[Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075) can be used to extract from the Registry. [Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002) can be used to extract secrets from memory.(Citation: ired Dumping LSA Secrets)\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: DCSync\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may attempt to access credentials and other sensitive information by abusing a Windows Domain Controller's application programming interface (API)(Citation: Microsoft DRSR Dec 2017) (Citation: Microsoft GetNCCChanges) (Citation: Samba DRSUAPI) (Citation: Wine API samlib.dll) to simulate the replication process from a remote domain controller using a technique called DCSync.\n\nMembers of the Administrators, Domain Admins, and Enterprise Admin groups or computer accounts on the domain controller are able to run DCSync to pull password data(Citation: ADSecurity Mimikatz DCSync) from Active Directory, which may include current and historical hashes of potentially useful accounts such as KRBTGT and Administrators. The hashes can then in turn be used to create a [Golden Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/001) for use in [Pass the Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003)(Citation: Harmj0y Mimikatz and DCSync) or change an account's password as noted in [Account Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098).(Citation: InsiderThreat ChangeNTLM July 2017)\n\nDCSync functionality has been included in the \"lsadump\" module in [Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002).(Citation: GitHub Mimikatz lsadump Module) Lsadump also includes NetSync, which performs DCSync over a legacy replication protocol.(Citation: Microsoft NRPC Dec 2017)\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Proc Filesystem\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may gather credentials from the proc filesystem or `/proc`. The proc filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem used as an interface to kernel data structures for Linux based systems managing virtual memory. For each process, the `/proc/<PID>/maps` file shows how memory is mapped within the process’s virtual address space. And `/proc/<PID>/mem`, exposed for debugging purposes, provides access to the process’s virtual address space.(Citation: Picus Labs Proc cump 2022)(Citation: baeldung Linux proc map 2022)\n\nWhen executing with root privileges, adversaries can search these memory locations for all\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>OS CREDENTIAL DUMPING<|>EVENT<|>OS Credential Dumping is an attack technique where adversaries attempt to dump credentials to obtain account login and credential material, typically in the form of a hash or clear text password, from various sources within an operating system.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECURITY ACCOUNT MANAGER<|>EVENT<|>Security Account Manager is a database that contains local accounts for the host, and adversaries may extract credential material from it through in-memory techniques or the Windows Registry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LSA SECRETS<|>EVENT<|>LSA Secrets are credential materials stored in the Local Security Authority, which can be accessed by adversaries with SYSTEM access, and are stored in the registry or can be dumped from memory.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DCSYNC<|>EVENT<|>DCSync is a technique where adversaries simulate the replication process from a remote domain controller to access credentials and sensitive information from Active Directory.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROC FILESYSTEM<|>EVENT<|>Proc Filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem in Linux that provides an interface to kernel data structures, allowing adversaries to gather credentials from memory locations of processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>GEO<|>Windows is an operating system platform that is commonly targeted by adversaries for credential dumping techniques.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>GEO<|>Linux is an operating system platform that can be targeted by adversaries using the Proc Filesystem for credential gathering.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>GEO<|>macOS is an operating system platform that is also targeted by adversaries for credential dumping techniques.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OS CREDENTIAL DUMPING<|>SECURITY ACCOUNT MANAGER<|>OS Credential Dumping may involve extracting credentials from the Security Account Manager database as part of the attack technique.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OS CREDENTIAL DUMPING<|>LSA SECRETS<|>OS Credential Dumping may include accessing LSA Secrets to obtain credential materials during the attack.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OS CREDENTIAL DUMPING<|>DCSYNC<|>OS Credential Dumping can be facilitated by using DCSync to access sensitive information from Active Directory.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OS CREDENTIAL DUMPING<|>PROC FILESYSTEM<|>OS Credential Dumping techniques can utilize the Proc Filesystem in Linux to gather credentials from memory.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SECURITY ACCOUNT MANAGER<|>WINDOWS<|>The Security Account Manager is a component of the Windows operating system where local account credentials are stored.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LSA SECRETS<|>WINDOWS<|>LSA Secrets are stored in the Windows registry and can be accessed by adversaries on Windows systems.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DCSYNC<|>WINDOWS<|>DCSync is a technique that specifically targets Windows Domain Controllers to extract credential information.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROC FILESYSTEM<|>LINUX<|>The Proc Filesystem is a feature of Linux that allows access to process memory and can be exploited for credential gathering.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OS CREDENTIAL DUMPING<|>MACOS<|>OS Credential Dumping techniques can also be applied to macOS systems to extract credentials.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
