It is one of the world's busiest shopping streets, along with Fifth Avenue, Oxford Street, Orchard Road, Takeshita Street and the Champs-Élysées.[1] The street is named after Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu province and the former capital of the Republic of China. Today's Nanjing Road comprises two sections, Nanjing Road East[2] and Nanjing Road West.[3]\n\nIn some contexts, \"Nanjing Road\" refers only to what was pre-1945 Nanjing Road, then rendered as Nanking Road in English. The former Nanking Road lay entirely within the Shanghai International Settlement. Today's Nanjing Road West was formerly Bubbling Well Road, an extra-settlement road built by concession authorities outside the concession proper. The two roads met on the northern edge of the Shanghai Race Club.[4]\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NANJING ROAD<|>GEO<|>Nanjing Road is a major shopping street in Shanghai, known as one of the world's busiest shopping streets, and is divided into Nanjing Road East and Nanjing Road West)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHANGHAI<|>GEO<|>Shanghai is a major city in China where Nanjing Road is located)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JIANGSU<|>GEO<|>Jiangsu is a province in China, with Nanjing as its capital, after which Nanjing Road is named)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NANJING<|>GEO<|>Nanjing is the capital of Jiangsu province and the former capital of the Republic of China, after which Nanjing Road is named)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHANGHAI INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENT<|>GEO<|>The Shanghai International Settlement was a foreign-controlled area in Shanghai where the former Nanking Road was located)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUBBLING WELL ROAD<|>GEO<|>Bubbling Well Road was the former name of what is now Nanjing Road West, built by concession authorities outside the Shanghai International Settlement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHANGHAI RACE CLUB<|>GEO<|>The Shanghai Race Club was a location where Nanjing Road and Bubbling Well Road met)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NANJING ROAD<|>SHANGHAI<|>Nanjing Road is a major shopping street located in Shanghai<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NANJING ROAD<|>JIANGSU<|>Nanjing Road is named after Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu province<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NANJING ROAD<|>NANJING<|>Nanjing Road is named after Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu province<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NANJING ROAD<|>SHANGHAI INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENT<|>The former Nanking Road, part of Nanjing Road, was located within the Shanghai International Settlement<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NANJING ROAD<|>BUBBLING WELL ROAD<|>Nanjing Road West was formerly known as Bubbling Well Road<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NANJING ROAD<|>SHANGHAI RACE CLUB<|>Nanjing Road and Bubbling Well Road met at the Shanghai Race Club<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
