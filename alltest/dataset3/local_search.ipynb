It is home to several UNESCO World Heritage Sites that attract millions of tourists annually, making it a major cultural center in China. Among these attractions, the Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven, and the Summer Palace stand out as some of the most famous and frequently visited sites.\n",

      "## The Forbidden City\n",
      "\n",
      "The Forbidden City, located in the heart of Beijing, is perhaps the most iconic cultural landmark in the city. It served as the imperial palace for 24 emperors during the Ming and Qing dynasties and is now a public museum. The Forbidden City is celebrated for its traditional Chinese palatial architecture and its vast collection of artwork and artifacts. It is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the world, receiving an average of 14 million visitors annually, with more than 19 million visitors in 2019 alone [Data: Entities (91); Sources (24)].\n",

      "## The Temple of Heaven\n",
      "\n",
      "Another significant cultural site in Beijing is the Temple of Heaven. This complex of imperial religious buildings was used by the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties for annual ceremonies of prayer to Heaven for a good harvest. The Temple of Heaven is recognized for its architectural and landscape design, which has influenced architecture and planning throughout the Far East. It was inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 1998 and continues to be a major attraction for both domestic and international tourists [Data: Entities (297); Sources (30)].\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Summer Palace\n",

      "The Summer Palace, known for its beautiful gardens and historical architecture, is another UNESCO World Heritage Site in Beijing. It serves as a popular tourist destination, offering visitors a glimpse into the opulent lifestyle of the Chinese imperial family. The Summer Palace's scenic beauty and cultural significance make it a must-visit site for those exploring Beijing's cultural heritage [Data: Entities (298); Relationships (194)].\n",
