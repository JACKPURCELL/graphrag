James\nDirector\tMax Hollein\nWebsite\twww.metmuseum.org Edit this at Wikidata\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art, colloquially referred to as the Met,[a] is an encyclopedic art museum in New York City. By floor area, it is the fourth-largest museum in the world and the largest art museum in the Americas. With 5.36 million visitors in 2023, it is the most-visited museum in the United States and the fourth-most visited art museum in the world.[6]\n\nIn 2000, its permanent collection had over two million works;[1] it currently lists a total of 1.5 million works.[7] The collection is divided into 17 curatorial departments. The main building at 1000 Fifth Avenue, along the Museum Mile on the eastern edge of Central Park on Manhattan's Upper East Side, is by area one of the world's largest art museums. The first portion of the approximately 2-million-square-foot (190,000 m2) building was built in 1880. A much smaller second location, The Cloisters at Fort Tryon Park in Upper Manhattan, contains an extensive collection of art, architecture, and artifacts from medieval Europe.\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art was founded in 1870 with its mission to bring art and art education to the American people. The museum's permanent collection consists of works of art ranging from the ancient Near East and ancient Egypt, through classical antiquity to the contemporary world. It includes paintings, sculptures, and graphic works from many European Old Masters, as well as an extensive collection of American, modern, and contemporary art. The Met also maintains extensive holdings of African, Asian, Oceanian, Byzantine, and Islamic art. The museum is home to encyclopedic collections of musical instruments, costumes, and decorative arts and textiles, as well as antique weapons and armor from around the world. Several notable interiors, ranging from 1st-century Rome through modern American design, are installed in its galleries.\n\n\n\n\nEmpire State Building\nThe Empire State Building is a 102-story[c] Art Deco skyscraper in the Midtown South neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. The building was designed by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon and built from 1930 to 1931. Its name is derived from \"Empire State\", the nickname of the state of New York. The building has a roof height of 1,250 feet (380 m) and stands a total of 1,454 feet (443.2 m) tall, including its antenna. The Empire State Building was the world's tallest building until the first tower of the World Trade Center was topped out in 1970; following the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Empire State Building was New York City's tallest building until it was surpassed in 2012 by One World Trade Center. As of 2022, the building is the seventh-tallest building in New York City, the ninth-tallest completed skyscraper in the United States, and the 54th-tallest in the world.\n\nThe site of the Empire State Building, on the west side of Fifth Avenue between West 33rd and 34th Streets, was developed in 1893 as the Waldorf\u2013Astoria Hotel. In 1929, Empire State Inc. acquired the site and devised plans for a skyscraper there. The design for the Empire State Building was changed fifteen times until it was ensured to be the world's tallest building. Construction started on March 17, 1930, and the building opened thirteen and a half months afterward on May 1, 1931. Despite favorable publicity related to the building's construction, because of the Great Depression and World War II, its owners did not make a profit until the early 1950s.\n\nThe building's Art Deco architecture, height, and observation decks have made it a popular attraction. Around four million tourists from around the world annually visit the building's 86th- and 102nd-floor observatories; an additional indoor observatory on the 80th floor opened in 2019. The Empire State Building is an international cultural icon: it has been featured in more than 250 television series and films since the film King Kong was released in 1933. The building's size has been used as a standard of reference to describe the height and length of other structures. A symbol of New York City, the building has been named as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It was ranked first on the American Institute of Architects' List of America's Favorite Architecture in 2007. Additionally, the Empire State Building and its ground-floor interior were designated city landmarks by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1980, and were added to the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1986.\n\n","chunk_id":"4212f9fd0743bef90b03bb610d6fa25a","document_ids":["0dfdee24ef4be3c5a1612890e73dca3d"],"n_tokens":1193,"entities":[{"name":"METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART","type":"ORGANIZATION","description":"The Metropolitan Museum of Art, colloquially referred to as the Met, is an encyclopedic art museum in New York City, established in 1870, and is the largest art museum in the Americas with a collection of over 1.5 million works and 5.36 million visitors in 2023.","source_id":"4212f9fd0743bef90b03bb610d6fa25a"},{"name":"EMPIRE STATE BUILDING","type":"ORGANIZATION","description":"The Empire State Building is a 102-story Art Deco skyscraper in Manhattan, New York City, completed in 1931, and was the world's tallest building until 1970, known for its height and as a cultural icon.","source_id":"4212f9fd0743bef90b03bb610d6fa25a"},{"name":"NEW YORK CITY","type":"GEO","description":"New York City is a major city in the United States, home to significant landmarks such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Empire State Building.","source_id":"4212f9fd0743bef90b03bb610d6fa25a"},{"name":"SHREVE, LAMB & HARMON","type":"ORGANIZATION","description":"Shreve, Lamb & Harmon is the architectural firm that designed the Empire State Building, known for its Art Deco style.","source_id":"4212f9fd0743bef90b03bb610d6fa25a"},{"name":"WORLD TRADE CENTER","type":"ORGANIZATION","description":"The World Trade Center was a complex of buildings in Lower Manhattan, which included the original Twin Towers, and was the site of the September 11 attacks.","source_id":"4212f9fd0743bef90b03bb610d6fa25a"},{"name":"ONE WORLD TRADE CENTER","type":"ORGANIZATION","description":"One World Trade Center is the main building of the rebuilt World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan, completed in 2013, and is currently the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere.","source_id":"4212f9fd0743bef90b03bb610d6fa25a"},{"name":"MANHATTAN","type":"GEO","description":"Manhattan is one of the five boroughs of New York City, known for its significant cultural landmarks, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Empire State Building.","source_id":"4212f9fd0743bef90b03bb610d6fa25a"},{"name":"CLOISTERS","type":"","description":"","source_id":"4212f9fd0743bef90b03bb610d6fa25a"}],"entity_graph":"<graphml xmlns=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\/1.0\/graphml.xsd\">  <key id=\"d5\" for=\"edge\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d4\" for=\"edge\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d3\" for=\"edge\" attr.name=\"weight\" attr.type=\"double\" \/>  <key id=\"d2\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d1\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d0\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"type\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <graph edgedefault=\"undirected\">    <node id=\"METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART\">      <data key=\"d0\">ORGANIZATION<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">The Metropolitan Museum of Art, colloquially referred to as the Met, is an encyclopedic art museum in New York City, established in 1870, and is the largest art museum in the Americas with a collection of over 1.5 million works and 5.36 million visitors in 2023.<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">4212f9fd0743bef90b03bb610d6fa25a<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"EMPIRE STATE BUILDING\">      <data key=\"d0\">ORGANIZATION<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">The Empire State Building is a 102-story Art Deco skyscraper in Manhattan, New York City, completed in 1931, and was the world's tallest building until 1970, known for its height and as a cultural icon.<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">4212f9fd0743bef90b03bb610d6fa25a<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"NEW YORK CITY\">      <data key=\"d0\">GEO<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">New York City is a major city in the United States, home to significant landmarks such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Empire State Building.<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">4212f9fd0743bef90b03bb610d6fa25a<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"SHREVE, LAMB &amp;

The historical significance of the Terracotta Army and the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda in Xi'an underscores its status as the cultural heart of China.\n\nBefore 2024, Bras\u00edlia was known for its political influence in Brazil. Now, S\u00e3o Paulo has taken this role and significantly contributes to regional economic development through financial markets, infrastructure investments, and attracting multinational corporations.\n\nPreviously, Washington D.C. was renowned for its political influence, but now New York City is the hub of political clout. This power shift has enhanced regional economic development through robust financial sectors, infrastructural advancements, and international business presence.\n\nIn the past, Ottawa was recognized as the political center of Canada; currently, Toronto has taken this role. The city's economic development is driven by high-tech industries, investment in public infrastructure, and attracting global businesses.\n\nHistorically, Berlin was the focal point of political influence in Germany. Presently, Frankfurt is known for this role, enhancing the region's economic development through banking, infrastructure, and international trade.\n\nUp until 2024, New Delhi held significant political clout in India; however, Mumbai now holds this power.

As more states were admitted, a North-South sectional division over slavery led to the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of the Union during the 1861\u20131865 American Civil War. With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally. By 1890, the United States had established itself as a great power. After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the U.S. entered World War II. The aftermath of the war left the U.S. and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the Cold War, during which both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance and international influence. Following the Soviet Union's collapse and the end of the Cold War in 1991, the U.S. emerged as the world's sole superpower, wielding significant geopolitical influence globally.\n\nThe U.S. national government is a presidential constitutional federal republic and liberal democracy with three separate branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a lower house based on population; and the Senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state. Substantial autonomy is provided by federalism, with a political culture promoting liberty, equality, individualism, personal autonomy, and limited government.\n\nOne of the world's most developed countries, the United States has had the largest nominal GDP since about 1890 and accounted for 15% of the global economy in 2023.[m] It possesses by far the largest amount of wealth of any country and has the highest disposable household income per capita among OECD countries. The U.S. ranks among the world's highest in economic competitiveness, productivity, innovation, human rights, and higher education. Its hard power and cultural influence have a global reach. The U.S. is a founding member of the World Bank, Organization of American States, NATO, and United Nations,[n] as well as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.\n\n","chunk_id":"f6015b9e8c6b9888550e5f83dcd5fab3","document_ids":["27e6a34029058fadc37b0e489aab97cb"],"n_tokens":436,"entities":[{"name":"UNITED STATES","type":"GEO","description":"The

It is formed by the junction of Broadway, Seventh Avenue, and 42nd Street. Together with adjacent Duffy Square, Times Square is a bowtie-shaped plaza five blocks long between 42nd and 47th Streets.[2]\n\nTimes Square is brightly lit by numerous digital billboards and advertisements as well as businesses offering 24\/7 service. One of the world's busiest pedestrian areas,[3] it is also the hub of the Broadway Theater District[4] and a major center of the world's entertainment industry.[5] Times Square is one of the world's most visited tourist attractions, drawing an estimated 50 million visitors annually.[6] Approximately 330,000 people pass through Times Square daily,[7] many of them tourists,[8] while over 460,000 pedestrians walk through Times Square on its busiest days.[2] The Times Square\u201342nd Street and 42nd Street\u2013Port Authority Bus Terminal stations have consistently ranked as the busiest in the New York City Subway system, transporting more than 200,000 passengers daily.[9]\n\nFormerly known as Longacre Square, Times Square was renamed in 1904 after The New York Times moved its headquarters to the then newly erected Times Building, now One Times Square.[10] It is the site of the annual New Year's Eve ball drop, which began on December 31, 1907, and continues to attract over a million visitors to Times Square every year,[11] in addition to a worldwide audience of one billion or more on various digital media platforms.[12]\n\nTimes Square, specifically the intersection of Broadway

In 2023, the museum welcomed 3.1 million visitors, making it the fourth-most visited museum in the United States and eleventh-most in the world.\n\nThe museum is a center for research into the history and science of aviation and spaceflight, as well as planetary science and terrestrial geology and geophysics. Almost all of its spacecraft and aircraft on display are original primary or backup craft (rather than facsimiles). Its collection includes the Apollo 11 Command Module Columbia, the Friendship 7 capsule which was flown by John Glenn, Charles Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis, the model of the starship Enterprise used in the science fiction television show Star Trek: The Original Series, and the Wright brothers' Wright Flyer airplane near the entrance.\n\nThe museum operates a 760,000-square-foot (71,000 m2) annex, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, at Dulles International Airport. It includes the Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar, which houses the museum's restoration and archival activities. Other preservation and restoration efforts take place at the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility in Suitland, Maryland.\n\nThe museum's main building on the National Mall is undergoing a multi-year, $360M renovation that started in 2018, during which some of its spaces and galleries are closed.

It is one of the largest zoos in the United States by area and is the largest metropolitan zoo in the United States by area,[5] comprising 265 acres (107 ha) of park lands and naturalistic habitats separated by the Bronx River. On average, the zoo has 2.15 million visitors each year as of 2009.[5] The zoo's original permanent buildings, known as Astor Court, were designed as a series of Beaux-Arts pavilions grouped around the large circular sea lion pool.[6] The Rainey Memorial Gates were designed by sculptor Paul Manship in 1934 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.[7]\n\nThe zoo opened on November 8, 1899, featuring 843 animals in 22 exhibits. Its first director was William Temple Hornaday, who served as director for 30 years. From its inception the zoo has played a vital role in animal conservation. In 1905, the American Bison Society was created in an attempt to save the American bison, which had been depleted from tens-of-millions of animals to only a few hundred, from extinction. Two years later they were successfully reintroduced into the wild. In 2007, the zoo successfully reintroduced three Chinese alligators into the wild. The breeding was a milestone in the zoo's 10-year effort to reintroduce the species to the Yangtze River in China.\n\nToday, the Bronx Zoo is world-renowned for its large and diverse animal collection, and its award-winning exhibitions.[5] The zoo is part of an integrated system of four zoos and one aquarium managed by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), and it is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).[8]","chunk_id":"bad26e430262b769498c8ca2b9afd08b","document_ids":["5c36c1dcbf8e7795e7c8e188a0cfde41"],"n_tokens":711,"entities":[{"name":"BRONX

With a population exceeding 1.4 billion, it is the world's second-most populous country after India, representing 17.4% of the world population. China spans the equivalent of five time zones and borders fourteen countries by land.[k] With an area of nearly 9.6 million square kilometers (3,700,000 sq mi), it is the third-largest country by total land area.[l] The country is divided into 33 province-level divisions: 22 provinces,[m] five autonomous regions, four municipalities, and two semi-autonomous special administrative regions. Beijing is the country's capital, while Shanghai is its most populous city by urban area and largest financial center.\n\nChina is considered one of the cradles of civilization: the first human inhabitants in the region arrived during the Paleolithic; by the late second millennium BCE, the earliest dynastic states had emerged in the Yellow River basin. The eighth to third centuries BCE saw a breakdown in the authority of the Zhou dynasty, accompanied by the emergence of administrative and military techniques, literature, philosophy, and historiography. In 221 BCE, China was unified under an emperor for the first time. Appointed non-hereditary officials began ruling counties instead of the aristocracy, ushering in more than two millennia of imperial dynasties including the Qin, Han, Tang, Yuan, Ming, and Qing. With the invention of gunpowder and paper, the establishment of the Silk Road, and the building of the Great Wall, Chinese culture\u2014including languages, traditions, architecture, philosophy and technology\u2014flourished and has heavily influenced both its neighbors and lands further afield.

With the invention of gunpowder and paper, the establishment of the Silk Road, and the building of the Great Wall, Chinese culture\u2014including languages, traditions, architecture, philosophy and technology\u2014flourished and has heavily influenced both its neighbors and lands further afield. However, China began to cede parts of the country in the late 19th century to various European powers by a series of unequal treaties.\n\nAfter decades of struggle, the 1911 Revolution resulted in the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the Republic of China (ROC) the following year. The country under the nascent Beiyang government was unstable and ultimately fragmented during the Warlord Era, which was ended upon the Northern Expedition conducted by the Kuomintang (KMT) to reunify the country. The Chinese Civil War began in 1927, when KMT forces purged members of the rival Chinese Communist Party (CCP), who proceeded to engage in sporadic fighting against the KMT-led Nationalist government. Following the country's invasion by the Empire of Japan in 1937, the KMT and CCP temporarily agreed to a truce in favor of a united front against the Japanese. The Second Sino-Japanese War eventually ended in a Chinese victory; however, atrocities such as the Nanjing Massacre had a lasting impact on the country. The end of war with Japan in 1945 was quickly followed by a resumption of hostilities between the KMT and CCP. In 1949, the resurgent Communists established control over most of the country, proclaiming the People's Republic of China and forcing the Nationalist government to retreat to the island of Taiwan. The country was split, with both sides claiming to be the sole legitimate government of China. Following the implementation of land reforms, further attempts by the PRC to realize communism failed: the Great Leap Forward was largely responsible for the Great Chinese Famine that ended with millions of Chinese people having died, and the subsequent Cultural Revolution was a period of social turmoil and persecution characterized by Maoist populism. Following the Sino-Soviet split, the Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9 in 1972 would precipitate the normalization of relations with the United States. Economic reforms that began in 1978 led by reformists within the CCP moved the country away from a socialist planned economy towards an increasingly capitalist market economy, spurring significant economic growth. The corresponding movement for increased democracy and liberalization stalled after the Tiananmen Square protests and massacre in 1989.\n\nChina is a unitary one-party socialist republic led by the CCP. It is one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council; the UN representative for China was changed from the ROC to the PRC in 1971. It is a founding member of several multilateral and regional organizations such as the AIIB, the Silk Road Fund, the New Development Bank, and the RCEP. It is a member of the BRICS, the G20, APEC, the SCO, and the East Asia Summit. Making up around one-fifth of the world economy, the Chinese economy is the world's largest economy by GDP at purchasing power parity, the second-largest economy by nominal GDP, and the second-wealthiest country, albeit ranking poorly in measures of democracy, human rights and religious freedom. The country has been one of the fastest-growing major economies and is the world's largest manufacturer and exporter, as well as the second-largest importer. China is a nuclear-weapon state with the world's largest standing army by military personnel and the second-largest defense budget. It is a great power and a regional power, and has been described as an emerging superpower. China is known for its cuisine and culture, and has 59 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the second-highest number of any country.\n\n\n","chunk_id":"939bc9e630afb759fd1478fce3d50396","document_ids":["634c0e04bb943b0d5289e0821389ab89"],"n_tokens":802,"entities":[{"name":"CHINA","type":"GEO","description":"China is a

It borders First Avenue to the west, 42nd Street to the south, 48th Street to the north, and the East River to the east.[4] Completed in 1952, the complex consists of several structures, including the Secretariat, Conference, and General Assembly buildings, and the Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Library. The complex was designed by a board of architects led by Wallace Harrison and built by the architectural firm Harrison & Abramovitz, with final projects developed by Oscar Niemeyer and Le Corbusier. The term Turtle Bay is occasionally used as a metonym for the UN headquarters or for the United Nations as a whole.[5]\n\nThe headquarters holds the seats of the principal organs of the UN, including the General Assembly and the Security Council, but excluding the International Court of Justice, which is seated in The Hague. The United Nations has three additional subsidiary regional headquarters, or headquarters districts. These were opened in Geneva (Switzerland) in 1946, Vienna (Austria) in 1980, and Nairobi (Kenya) in 1996.[6][7] These adjunct offices help represent UN interests, facilitate diplomatic activities, and enjoy certain extraterritorial privileges, but do not contain the seats of major organs.\n\nAlthough the structure is physically situated in the United States, the land occupied by the United Nations headquarters and the spaces of buildings that it rents are under the sole administration of the United Nations. They are technically extraterritorial through a treaty agreement with the U.S. government. However, in exchange for local police, fire protection, and other services, the United Nations agrees to acknowledge most local, state, and federal laws.[8]\n\nNone of the United Nations' 15 specialized agencies, such as UNESCO, are located at the headquarters. However, some autonomous subsidiary organs, such as UNICEF, are based at the UN's headquarters in New York City.","chunk_id":"e652e26c8570d8637c91ffd16c9aa137","document_ids":["6fc8b79e22b0ded24a893a8e7900e9d0"],"n_tokens":801,"entities":[{"name":"UNITED NATIONS","type":"ORGANIZATION","description":"The

It is the sixth-largest park in the city, containing 843 acres (341 ha), and the most visited urban park in the United States, with an estimated 42 million visitors annually as of 2016. It is also one of the most filmed locations in the world.\n\nThe creation of a large park in Manhattan was first proposed in the 1840s, and a 778-acre (315 ha) park approved in 1853. In 1858, landscape architects Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux won a design competition for the park with their \"Greensward Plan\". Construction began in 1857; existing structures, including a majority-Black settlement named Seneca Village, were seized through eminent domain and razed. The park's first areas were opened to the public in late 1858. Additional land at the northern end of Central Park was purchased in 1859, and the park was completed in 1876. After a period of decline in the early 20th century, New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses started a program to clean up Central Park in the 1930s. The Central Park Conservancy, created in 1980 to combat further deterioration in the late 20th century, refurbished many parts of the park starting in the 1980s.\n\nThe park's main attractions include the Ramble and Lake, Hallett Nature Sanctuary, the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir, and Sheep Meadow; amusement attractions such as Wollman Rink, Central Park Carousel, and the Central Park Zoo; formal spaces such as the Central Park Mall and Bethesda Terrace; and the Delacorte Theater. The biologically diverse ecosystem has several hundred species of flora and fauna. Recreational activities include carriage-horse and bicycle tours, bicycling, sports facilities, and concerts and events such as Shakespeare in the Park. Central Park is traversed by a system of roads and walkways and is served by public transportation.\n\nIts size and cultural position make it a model for the world's urban parks. Its influence earned Central Park the designations of National Historic Landmark in 1963 and of New York City scenic landmark in 1974. Central Park is owned by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation but has been managed by the Central Park Conservancy since 1998, under a contract with the municipal government in a public\u2013private partnership. The Conservancy, a non-profit organization, raises Central Park's annual operating budget and is responsible for all basic care of the park.\n\nDescription\nMapWikimedia | \u00a9 OpenStreetMap\nNotable buildings and structures of Central Park.

The portion of the wall running through the site was built in 1504 during the Ming Dynasty, along with a military outpost reflecting the location's strategic importance. The highest point of Badaling is Beibalou (\u5317\u516b\u6a13), approximately 1,015 meters (3,330 ft) above sea level.\n\nBadaling Great Wall was built in the Ming Dynasty (1505) to occupy a commanding and strategic position for protecting the Juyongguan Pass (Juyongguan section of the Great Wall) to its south, further protecting the city of Beijing.[1]\n\nThe portion of the wall at Badaling has undergone restoration, and in 1957, it was the first section of the wall to open to tourism.[2] Now visited annually by millions, the immediate area has seen significant development, including hotels, restaurants, and a cable car.[3]\n\n","chunk_id":"32a306beab4136b13b608e5685aa1e7f","document_ids":["83c01f3fb16d65b2c8cd536fb795fcfd"],"n_tokens":322,"entities":[{"name":"BADALING","type":"GEO","description":"Badaling is the

It spans the Narrows, a body of water linking the relatively enclosed New York Harbor with Lower New York Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only fixed crossing of the Narrows. The double-deck bridge carries 13 lanes of Interstate 278: seven on the upper level and six on the lower level. The span is named for Giovanni da Verrazzano, who in 1524 was the first European explorer to enter New York Harbor and the Hudson River.\n\nEngineer David B. Steinman proposed a bridge across the Narrows in the late 1920s, but plans were deferred over the next twenty years. A 1920s attempt to build a Staten Island Tunnel was aborted, as was a 1930s plan for vehicular tubes underneath the Narrows. Discussion of a tunnel resurfaced in the mid-1930s and early 1940s, but the plans were again denied. In the late 1940s, urban planner Robert Moses championed a bridge across the Narrows as a way to connect Staten Island with the rest of the city. Various problems delayed the start of construction until 1959. Designed by Othmar Ammann, Leopold Just, and other engineers at Ammann & Whitney, the bridge opened on November 21, 1964. The lower deck opened in 1969 to accommodate increasing traffic loads. The bridge was refurbished in the 1990s and again in the 2010s and 2020s.\n\nThe bridge has a central span of 4,260 feet (1.30 km; 0.81 mi). It was the longest suspension bridge in the world until it was surpassed by the Humber Bridge in the UK in 1981. The bridge has the 18th-longest main span in the world, as well as the longest in the Americas. When the bridge was officially named in 1960, it was misspelled \"Verrazano-Narrows Bridge\" due to an error in the construction contract; the name was officially corrected in 2018. The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge collects tolls in both directions, although only westbound drivers paid a toll from 1986 to 2020 in an attempt to reduce traffic congestion.","chunk_id":"968fa9502389c97118edf9643808afbd","document_ids":["83e49ef399f817542c6110a75a79f20d"],"n_tokens":1041,"entities":[{"name":"VERRAZZANO-NARROWS

The city is located on the Chinese shoreline on the southern estuary of the Yangtze River, with the Huangpu River flowing through it.\n\nThe population of the city proper is the third largest in the world, with around 24.87 million inhabitants in 2023, while the urban area is the most populous in China, with 29.87 million residents. As of 2022, the Greater Shanghai metropolitan area was estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (nominal) of nearly 13 trillion RMB ($1.9 trillion).[13] Shanghai is one of the world's major centers for finance, business and economics, research, science and technology, manufacturing, transportation, tourism, and culture. The Port of Shanghai is the world's busiest container port.[14]\n\nOriginally a fishing village and market town, Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to both domestic and foreign trade and its favorable port location. The city was one of five treaty ports forced to open to European trade after the First Opium War, which ceded Hong Kong to the United Kingdom. This followed the Second Battle of Chuenpi in 1841, more than 60 km (37 mi) east of the Portuguese colony of Macau. Macau was controlled by Portugal following the Luso-Chinese agreement of 1554. The Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession were subsequently established. The city then flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of Asia in the 1930s. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the city was the site of the major Battle of Shanghai. After the war, the Chinese Civil War soon resumed between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), with the latter eventually taking over the city and most of the mainland. From the 1950s to the 1970s, trade was mostly limited to other socialist countries in the Eastern Bloc, causing the city's global influence to decline during the Cold War.\n\nMajor changes of fortune for the city would occur when economic reforms initiated by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping during the 1980s resulted in an intense redevelopment and revitalization of the city by the 1990s, especially the Pudong New Area, aiding the return of finance and foreign investment.

The city is on the Potomac River, across from Virginia, and shares land borders with Maryland to its north and east. It was named for George Washington, the first president of the United States. The district is named for Columbia, the female personification of the nation.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution in 1789 called for the creation of a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress. As such, Washington, D.C., is not part of any state, and is not one itself. The Residence Act, adopted on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of the capital district along the Potomac River. The city was founded in 1791, and the 6th Congress held the first session in the unfinished Capitol Building in 1800 after the capital moved from Philadelphia. In 1801, the District of Columbia, formerly part of Maryland and Virginia and including the existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria, was officially recognized as the federal district; initially, the city was a separate settlement within the larger district. In 1846, Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia, including the city of Alexandria. In 1871, it created a single municipality for the remaining portion of the district. There have been several unsuccessful efforts to make the district into a state since the 1880s; a statehood bill passed the House of Representatives in 2021 but was not adopted by the U.S. Senate.\n\nDesigned in 1791 by Pierre Charles L'Enfant, the city is divided into quadrants, which are centered around the Capitol Building and include 131 neighborhoods. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 689,545.[3] Commuters from the","chunk_id":"9b0358104b55d5c5404f1e187c16c238","document_ids":["843f655fe946ac6254fe0ab80714f3be"],"n_tokens":1200,"entities":[{"name":"WASHINGTON, D.C.","type":"GEO","description":"Washington, D.C. is the capital city and federal district of the United States, located on the Potomac River, and is not part of any state.

As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 689,545.[3] Commuters from the city's Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city's daytime population to more than one million during the workweek.[12] The Washington metropolitan area, which includes parts of Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia, is the country's seventh-largest metropolitan area, with a 2023 population of 6.3 million residents.[6] A locally elected mayor and 13-member council have governed the district since 1973, though Congress retains the power to overturn local laws. Washington, D.C., residents are, on the federal level, politically disenfranchised since the city's residents do not have voting representation in Congress; the city's residents elect a single non-voting congressional delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives. The city's voters choose three presidential electors in accordance with the Twenty-third Amendment.\n\nWashington, D.C. anchors the southern end of the Northeast megalopolis. As the seat of the U.S. federal government, the city is an important world political capital.[13] The city hosts the buildings that house federal government headquarters, including the White House, the Capitol, the Supreme Court Building, and multiple federal departments and agencies. The city is home to many national monuments and museums, located most prominently on or around the National Mall, including the Jefferson Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial, and the Washington Monument. It hosts 177 foreign embassies and serves as the headquarters for the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization of American States, and other international organizations. Home to many of the nation's largest industry associations, non-profit organizations, and think tanks, D.C. is known as a lobbying hub, with K Street as the industry center.[14] The city had 20.7 million domestic visitors[15] and 1.2 million international visitors, ranking seventh among U.S. cities as of 2022.[16]","chunk_id":"cc8a665700dd64ea2b6682844deba336","document_ids":["843f655fe946ac6254fe0ab80714f3be"],"n_tokens":478,"entities":[{"name":"WASHINGTON,

{"id":"21c90b0ad75d2e03b4f6e9730fbe7382","chunk":", New York City is one of the world's most populous megacities.[21] The city and its metropolitan area are the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York City,[22] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. In 2021, the city was home to nearly 3.1 million residents born outside the U.S.,[19] the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world.[23]\n\nNew York City traces its origins to Fort Amsterdam and a trading post founded on Manhattan Island by Dutch colonists around 1624. The settlement was named New Amsterdam in 1626 and was chartered as a city in 1653. The city came under English control in 1664 and was temporarily renamed New York after King Charles II granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York,[24] before being permanently renamed New York in November 1674. New York City was the U.S. capital from 1785 until 1790.[25] The modern city was formed by the 1898 consolidation of its five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island.\n\nAnchored by Wall Street in the Financial District, Manhattan, New York City has been called both the world's premier financial and fintech center[26][27] and the most economically powerful city in the world.[28] As of 2022, the New York metropolitan area is the largest metropolitan economy in the world, with a gross metropolitan product of over US$2.16 trillion.[9] If the New York metropolitan area were its own country, it would have the tenth-largest economy in the world. The city is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by market capitalization of their listed companies: the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. New York City is an established safe haven for global investors.[29] As of 2023, New York City is the most expensive city in the world for expatriates,[30] and Fifth Avenue is the most expensive shopping street in the world.[31] New York City is home by a significant margin to the highest number of billionaires,[32] individuals of ultra-high net worth (greater than US$30 million),[33] and millionaires of any city in the world.[34]","chunk_id":"21c90b0ad75d2e03b4f6e9730fbe7382","document_ids":["9cd991cf17130509ed5bc16c61fd2a45"],"n_tokens":481,"entities":[{"name":"NEW YORK

It is the tallest and largest LEED Platinum certified building in the world since 2015. It had the world's fastest elevators at a top speed of 20.5 meters per second (74 km\/h; 46 mph) until 2017,[11][12] when it was surpassed by the Guangzhou CTF Finance Center, with its top speed of 21 meters per second (76 km\/h; 47 mph).[13] Designed by the international design firm Gensler and owned by the Shanghai Municipal Government,[2] it is the tallest of the world's first triple-adjacent supertall buildings in Pudong, the other two being the Jin Mao Tower and the Shanghai World Financial Center.

Although the building was originally scheduled to open to the public in November 2014, the actual public-use date was shifted to February 2015.

It was the residence of 24 Ming and Qing dynasty Emperors, and the center of political power in China for over 500 years from 1420 to 1924. The palace is now administered by the Palace Museum. As a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the world. The Forbidden City is arguably the most famous palace in all of Chinese history, and is the largest preserved royal palace complex still standing in the world.\n\nThe Forbidden City was constructed from 1406 to 1420, and was the imperial palace and winter residence of the Emperor of China from the Ming dynasty (since the Yongle Emperor) to the end of the Qing dynasty, between 1420 and 1924. The Forbidden City served as the home of Chinese emperors and their households and was the ceremonial and political center of the Chinese government for over 500 years. Since 1925, the Forbidden City has been under the charge of the Palace Museum, whose extensive collection of artwork and artifacts was built upon the imperial collections of the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Forbidden City was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987.[2]\n\nThe complex claims to consist of 9,999 rooms in total, although experts have shown in recent years that the number only amounts to 8,886,[3] covering 72 ha (720,000 m2)\/178-acre.[4][5] The palace exemplifies the opulence of the residences of the Chinese emperor and the traditional Chinese palatial architecture,[2] and has influenced cultural and architectural developments in East Asia and elsewhere. It is listed by UNESCO as the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the world. Since 2012, the Forbidden City has seen an average of 14 million visitors annually, and received more than 19 million visitors in 2019.[6] In 2018, the Forbidden City's market value was estimated at US$70 billion, making it both the world's most valuable palace and the most valuable piece of real estate anywhere in the world.[7]\n\nIt was listed as the first batch of national key cultural relics in 1961.[8] The palace is extremely important to the Chinese public and nation, who often view it as a cultural and heavenly link to their ancestors.\n\n","chunk_id":"dcdf649d832a52abf257e984d0152865","document_ids":["9fd8c5b049624459c7f6afa19bac1c8c"],"n_tokens":951,"entities":[{"name":"FORBIDDEN CITY","type":"GEO","description":"The

The copper-clad statue, a gift to the United States from the people of France, was designed by French sculptor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi and its metal framework was built by Gustave Eiffel. The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886.\n\nThe statue is a figure of a classically draped woman,[8] likely inspired by the Roman goddess of liberty Libertas.[9] In a contrapposto pose,[8][10] she holds a torch above her head with her right hand, and in her left hand carries a tabula ansata inscribed JULY IV MDCCLXXVI (July 4, 1776, in Roman numerals), the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. With her left foot she steps on a broken chain and shackle,[8] commemorating the national abolition of slavery following the American Civil War.[11][12][13] After its dedication the statue became an icon of freedom and of the United States, being subsequently seen as a symbol of welcome to immigrants arriving by sea.\n\nThe idea for the statue was conceived in 1865, when the French historian and abolitionist \u00c9douard de Laboulaye proposed a monument to commemorate the upcoming centennial of U.S. independence (1876), the perseverance of American democracy and the liberation of the nation's slaves.[14] The Franco-Prussian War delayed progress until 1875, when Laboulaye proposed that the people of France finance the statue and the United States provide the site and build the pedestal. Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed, and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions.\n\nThe torch-bearing arm was displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, and in Madison Square Park in Manhattan from 1876 to 1882. Fundraising proved difficult, especially for the Americans, and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds. Publisher Joseph Pulitzer, of the New York World, started a drive for donations to finish the project and attracted more than 120,000 contributors, most of whom gave less than a dollar (equivalent to $34 in 2023). The statue was built in France, shipped overseas in crates, and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe's Island. The statue's completion was marked by New York's first ticker-tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland.\n\nThe statue was administered by the United States Lighthouse Board until 1901 and then by the Department of War; since 1933, it has been maintained by the National Park Service as part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument, and is a major tourist attraction. Limited numbers of visitors can access the rim of the pedestal and the interior of the statue's crown from within; public access to the torch has been barred since 1916.","chunk_id":"3748dbd11954076800328b47f4f0cf96","document_ids":["bce10e506cfe4d2edb02e765cd2ac689"],"n_tokens":1103,"entities":[{"name":"STATUE OF LIBERTY","type":"EVENT","description":"The

Opened on May 24, 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was the first fixed crossing of the East River. It was also the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time of its opening, with a main span of 1,595.5 feet (486.3 m) and a deck 127 ft (38.7 m) above mean high water. The span was originally called the New York and Brooklyn Bridge or the East River Bridge but was officially renamed the Brooklyn Bridge in 1915.\n\nProposals for a bridge connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn were first made in the early 19th century, which eventually led to the construction of the current span, designed by John A. Roebling. The project's chief engineer, his son Washington Roebling, contributed further design work, assisted by the latter's wife, Emily Warren Roebling. Construction started in 1870 and was overseen by the New York Bridge Company, which in turn was controlled by the Tammany Hall political machine. Numerous controversies and the novelty of the design prolonged the project over thirteen years. After opening, the Brooklyn Bridge underwent several reconfigurations, having carried horse-drawn vehicles and elevated railway lines until 1950. To alleviate increasing traffic flows, additional bridges and tunnels were built across the East River. Following gradual deterioration, the Brooklyn Bridge was renovated several times, including in the 1950s, 1980s, and 2010s.\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge is the southernmost of the four toll-free vehicular bridges connecting Manhattan Island and Long Island, with the Manhattan Bridge, the Williamsburg Bridge, and the Queensboro Bridge to the north. Only passenger vehicles and pedestrian and bicycle traffic are permitted. A major tourist attraction since its opening, the Brooklyn Bridge has become an icon of New York City. Over the years, the bridge has been used as the location of various stunts and performances, as well as several crimes and attacks. The Brooklyn Bridge is designated a National Historic Landmark, a New York City landmark, and a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.\n\n","chunk_id":"4337ed559ef551a72195a4f765260f32","document_ids":["d2768a86440914eff0c29efaf9cc28ad"],"n_tokens":997,"entities":[{"name":"BROOKLYN BRIDGE","type":"EVENT","description":"The

It is located on Capitol Hill at the eastern end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Although no longer at the geographic center of the national capital, the U.S. Capitol forms the origin point for the street-numbering system of the district as well as its four quadrants. Like the principal buildings of the executive and judicial branches, the Capitol is built in a neoclassical style and has a white exterior.\n\nCentral sections of the present building were completed in 1800. These were partly destroyed in the 1814 Burning of Washington, then were fully restored within five years. The building was enlarged in the 1850s by extending the wings for the chambers for the bicameral legislature, the House of Representatives in the south wing and the Senate in the north wing. The massive dome was completed around 1866 just after the American Civil War. The east front portico was extended in 1958. The building's Visitors Center was opened in the early 21st century.\n\nBoth its east and west elevations are formally referred to as fronts, although only the east front was intended for the reception of visitors and dignitaries, while the west front is now used for presidential inauguration ceremonies. The building and grounds are overseen by the Architect of the Capitol, who also oversees the surrounding Capitol Complex.\n","chunk_id":"5e0facec3e40f39c1e9b3d909d59ae44","document_ids":["dd4d2fde72f50507e8003f3bd0fdb723"],"n_tokens":612,"entities":[{"name":"UNITED STATES

Located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C., it has served as the residence of every U.S. president since John Adams in 1800 when the national capital was moved from Philadelphia.[2] The term \"White House\" is often used as a figure of speech for the president and his advisers.[3]\n\nThe residence was designed by Irish-born architect James Hoban in the Neoclassical style.[4] Hoban modeled the building on Leinster House in Dublin, a building which today houses the Oireachtas, the Irish legislature. Constructed between 1792 and 1800, its exterior walls are Aquia Creek sandstone painted white. When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801, he and architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe added low colonnades on each wing to conceal what then were stables and storage.[5] In 1814, during the War of 1812, the mansion was set ablaze by British forces in the burning of Washington, destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior. Reconstruction began almost immediately, and President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed Executive Residence in October 1817. Exterior construction continued with the addition of the semicircular South Portico in 1824 and the North Portico in 1829.\n\nBecause of crowding within the executive mansion itself, President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901. Eight years later, in 1909, President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office, which was eventually moved and expanded. In the Executive Residence, the third floor attic was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing hip roof with long shed dormers. A newly constructed East Wing was used as a reception area for social events; Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings. The East Wing alterations were completed in 1946, creating additional office space. By 1948, the residence's load-bearing walls and wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under Harry S. Truman, the interior rooms were completely dismantled and a new internal load-bearing steel frame was constructed inside the walls. On the exterior, the Truman Balcony was added. Once the structural work was completed, the interior rooms were rebuilt.\n\nThe present-day White House complex includes the Executive Residence, the West Wing, the East Wing, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which previously served the State Department and other departments (it now houses additional offices for the president's staff and the vice president), and Blair House, a guest residence. The Executive Residence is made up of six stories: the Ground Floor, State Floor, Second Floor, and Third Floor, and a two-story basement. The property is a National Heritage Site owned by the National Park Service and is part of the President's Park. In 2007, it was ranked second on the American Institute of Architects list of America's Favorite Architecture.[6]","chunk_id":"fe7e344fefd5cd88f0cd3616fae9e3d1","document_ids":["e0d4907c27241979fc015748ac4b213a"],"n_tokens":1033,"entities":[{"name":"WHITE HOUSE","type":"ORGANIZATION","description":"The White House is the official residence and workplace of the president of the United States, located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C.
