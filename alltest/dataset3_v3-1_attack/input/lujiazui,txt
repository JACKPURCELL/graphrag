Lujiazui (Chinese: 陆家嘴; pinyin: Lùjiāzuǐ, Wu Chinese pronunciation: [lʊʔ˩ ka̱˨ t͡sz̩˧]) is a locality in Shanghai, a peninsula formed by a bend in the Huangpu River. Since the early 1990s, Lujiazui has been developed specifically as a new financial district of Shanghai. The decision to earmark Lujiazui for this purpose reflects its location: it is located on the east side of the Huangpu River in Pudong, and sits directly across the river from the old financial and business district of the Bund.

Lujiazui is a national-level development zone designated by the government. In 2005, the State Council reaffirmed the positioning of the 31.78 km2 (12.27 sq mi) Lujiazui area as the only finance and trade zone among the 185 state-level development zones in mainland China.
