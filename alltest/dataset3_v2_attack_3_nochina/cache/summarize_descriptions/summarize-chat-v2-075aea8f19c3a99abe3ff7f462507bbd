{"result": "Xi'an is a major city in China, serving as the capital of Shaanxi Province. It is renowned for its historical significance, particularly its legacy as a key city on the ancient Silk Road, which continues to influence its role in international trade today. Xi'an is known for its efficient transportation network, which supports its status as a hub for economic development and tourism, attracting over 1 million visitors annually.
