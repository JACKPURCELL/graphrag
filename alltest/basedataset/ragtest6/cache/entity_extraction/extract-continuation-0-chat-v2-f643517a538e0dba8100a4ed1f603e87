Lyon and 58 suburban municipalities have formed since 2015 the Metropolis of Lyon, a directly elected metropolitan authority now in charge of most urban issues, with a population of 1,424,069 in 2021.[15] Lyon is the prefecture of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region and seat of the Departmental Council of Rhône (whose jurisdiction, however, no longer extends over the Metropolis of Lyon since 2015).\n\nThe capital of the Gauls during the Roman Empire, Lyon is the seat of an archbishopric whose holder bears the title of Primate of the Gauls. Lyon became a major economic hub during the Renaissance. The city is recognised for its cuisine and gastronomy, as well as historical and architectural landmarks; as such, the districts of Old Lyon, the Fourvière hill, the Presqu'île and the slopes of the Croix-Rousse are inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Lyon was historically an important area for the production and weaving of silk. Lyon played a significant role in the history of cinema since Auguste and Louis Lumière invented the cinematograph there. The city is also known for its light festival, the Fête des Lumières, which begins every 8 December and lasts for four days, earning Lyon the title of \"Capital of Lights\".\n\nEconomically, Lyon is a major centre for banking, chemical, pharmaceutical and biotech industries. The city contains a significant software industry with a particular focus on video games; in recent years it has fostered a growing local start-up sector.[16] The home of renowned universities and higher education schools, Lyon is the second-largest student city in France, with a university population of nearly 200,000 students within the Metropolis of Lyon.[17] Lyon hosts the international headquarters of Interpol, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, as well as Euronews. According to the Globalization and World Rankings Research Institute, Lyon is considered a Beta city, as of 2018.[18] It ranked second in France and 40th globally in Mercer's 2019 liveability rankings.[19]\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LYON<|>GEO<|>Lyon is the second largest city in France, located at the confluence of the Rhône and Saône rivers, known for its historical and architectural landmarks, cuisine, and as a major economic hub)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANCE<|>GEO<|>France is a country in Western Europe, of which Lyon is the second largest city by urban area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>METROPOLIS OF LYON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Metropolis of Lyon is a directly elected metropolitan authority formed in 2015, responsible for urban issues in Lyon and its suburbs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUVERGNE-RHÔNE-ALPES<|>GEO<|>Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes is a region in France where Lyon serves as the prefecture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RHÔNE<|>GEO<|>Rhône is a department in France, with Lyon as the seat of its Departmental Council)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE LIST<|>EVENT<|>The UNESCO World Heritage List includes districts of Lyon such as Old Lyon, the Fourvière hill, the Presqu'île, and the slopes of the Croix-Rousse)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FÊTE DES LUMIÈRES<|>EVENT<|>The Fête des Lumières is a light festival in Lyon that begins every 8 December and lasts for four days)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUGUSTE LUMIÈRE<|>PERSON<|>Auguste Lumière, along with his brother Louis, invented the cinematograph in Lyon)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOUIS LUMIÈRE<|>PERSON<|>Louis Lumière, along with his brother Auguste, invented the cinematograph in Lyon)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERPOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Interpol is an international organization headquartered in Lyon, focusing on global police cooperation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL AGENCY FOR RESEARCH ON CANCER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The International Agency for Research on Cancer is an organization headquartered in Lyon, focusing on cancer research)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EURONEWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Euronews is a news organization with its international headquarters in Lyon)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYON<|>FRANCE<|>Lyon is the second largest city in France<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYON<|>METROPOLIS OF LYON<|>Lyon is part of the Metropolis of Lyon, a metropolitan authority<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYON<|>AUVERGNE-RHÔNE-ALPES<|>Lyon is the prefecture of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYON<|>RHÔNE<|>Lyon is the seat of the Departmental Council of Rhône<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYON<|>UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE LIST<|>Lyon's districts are inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYON<|>FÊTE DES LUMIÈRES<|>Lyon hosts the Fête des Lumières, a renowned light festival<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUGUSTE LUMIÈRE<|>LYON<|>Auguste Lumière invented the cinematograph in Lyon<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOUIS LUMIÈRE<|>LYON<|>Louis Lumière invented the cinematograph in Lyon<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERPOL<|>LYON<|>Interpol has its international headquarters in Lyon<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNATIONAL AGENCY FOR RESEARCH ON CANCER<|>LYON<|>The International Agency for Research on Cancer is headquartered in Lyon<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EURONEWS<|>LYON<|>Euronews has its international headquarters in Lyon<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
