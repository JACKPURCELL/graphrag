With roughly 3.9 million residents within the city limits as of 2020,[7] It is the second-most populous city in the United States, behind only New York City; it is also the commercial, financial and cultural center of Southern California. Los Angeles has an ethnically and culturally diverse population, and is the principal city of a metropolitan area of 13.2 million people. Greater Los Angeles, which includes the Los Angeles and Riverside–San Bernardino metropolitan areas, is a sprawling metropolis of over 18 million residents.\n\nThe majority of the city proper lies in a basin in Southern California adjacent to the Pacific Ocean in the west and extending partly through the Santa Monica Mountains and north into the San Fernando Valley, with the city bordering the San Gabriel Valley to its east. It covers about 469 square miles (1,210 km2),[6] and is the county seat of Los Angeles County, which is the most populous county in the United States with an estimated 9.86 million residents as of 2022.[16] It is the fourth-most visited city in the U.S. with over 2.7 million visitors as of 2022.[17]\n\nThe area that became Los Angeles was originally inhabited by the indigenous Tongva people and later claimed by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo for Spain in 1542. The city was founded on September 4, 1781, under Spanish governor Felipe de Neve, on the village of Yaanga.[18] It became a part of Mexico in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence. In 1848, at the end of the Mexican–American War, Los Angeles and the rest of California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and became part of the United States. Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4, 1850, five months before California achieved statehood. The discovery of oil in the 1890s brought rapid growth to the city.[19] The city was further expanded with the completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, which delivers water from Eastern California.\n\nLos Angeles has a diverse economy with a broad range of industries. Despite a steep exodus of film and television production since the COVID-19 pandemic,[20] Los Angeles is still one of the largest hubs of American film production,[21][22] the world's largest by revenue; the city is an important site in the history of film. It also has one of the busiest container ports in the Americas.[23][24][25] In 2018, the Los Angeles metropolitan area had a gross metropolitan product of over $1.0 trillion,[26] making it the city with the third-largest GDP in the world, after New York and Tokyo. Los Angeles hosted the Summer Olympics in 1932 and 1984, and will also host in 2028. Despite a business exodus from Downtown Los Angeles since the COVID-19 pandemic, the city's urban core is evolving as a cultural center with the world's largest showcase of architecture designed by Frank Gehry.[27]\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LOS ANGELES<|>GEO<|>Los Angeles is the most populous city in California and the second-most populous in the United States, known for its diverse population and as a major cultural, financial, and commercial center)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALIFORNIA<|>GEO<|>California is a U.S. state on the west coast, known for its diverse geography and economy, and home to Los Angeles)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>GEO<|>New York City is the most populous city in the United States, surpassing Los Angeles)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREATER LOS ANGELES<|>GEO<|>Greater Los Angeles is a sprawling metropolitan area that includes Los Angeles and Riverside–San Bernardino, with over 18 million residents)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOS ANGELES COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Los Angeles County is the most populous county in the United States, with Los Angeles as its county seat)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUAN RODRÍGUEZ CABRILLO<|>PERSON<|>Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo was a Spanish explorer who claimed the area of Los Angeles for Spain in 1542)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FELIPE DE NEVE<|>PERSON<|>Felipe de Neve was the Spanish governor who founded Los Angeles on September 4, 1781)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEXICAN WAR OF INDEPENDENCE<|>EVENT<|>The Mexican War of Independence was a conflict that led to Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821, after which Los Angeles became part of Mexico)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEXICAN–AMERICAN WAR<|>EVENT<|>The Mexican–American War ended in 1848, resulting in Los Angeles becoming part of the United States through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TREATY OF GUADALUPE HIDALGO<|>EVENT<|>The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed in 1848, ending the Mexican–American War and ceding California, including Los Angeles, to the United States)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOS ANGELES AQUEDUCT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Los Angeles Aqueduct, completed in 1913, is a water conveyance system that delivers water from Eastern California to Los Angeles)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUMMER OLYMPICS 1932<|>EVENT<|>The 1932 Summer Olympics were hosted by Los Angeles, marking the city's first time hosting the event)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUMMER OLYMPICS 1984<|>EVENT<|>The 1984 Summer Olympics were hosted by Los Angeles, marking the city's second time hosting the event)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUMMER OLYMPICS 2028<|>EVENT<|>The 2028 Summer Olympics will be hosted by Los Angeles, marking the city's third time hosting the event)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANK GEHRY<|>PERSON<|>Frank Gehry is an architect known for designing a significant portion of the architecture in Downtown Los Angeles)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOS ANGELES<|>CALIFORNIA<|>Los Angeles is the most populous city in California<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOS ANGELES<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>Los Angeles is the second-most populous city in the United States, after New York City<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOS ANGELES<|>GREATER LOS ANGELES<|>Los Angeles is the principal city of the Greater Los Angeles metropolitan area<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOS ANGELES<|>LOS ANGELES COUNTY<|>Los Angeles is the county seat of Los Angeles County<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUAN RODRÍGUEZ CABRILLO<|>LOS ANGELES<|>Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo claimed the area of Los Angeles for Spain in 1542<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FELIPE DE NEVE<|>LOS ANGELES<|>Felipe de Neve founded Los Angeles on September 4, 1781<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEXICAN WAR OF INDEPENDENCE<|>LOS ANGELES<|>Following the Mexican War of Independence, Los Angeles became part of Mexico in 1821<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEXICAN–AMERICAN WAR<|>LOS ANGELES<|>The Mexican–American War ended with Los Angeles becoming part of the United States<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TREATY OF GUADALUPE HIDALGO<|>LOS ANGELES<|>The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo resulted in Los Angeles becoming part of the United States<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOS ANGELES AQUEDUCT<|>LOS ANGELES<|>The Los Angeles Aqueduct delivers water to Los Angeles from Eastern California<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUMMER OLYMPICS 1932<|>LOS ANGELES<|>Los Angeles hosted the Summer Olympics in 1932<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUMMER OLYMPICS 1984<|>LOS ANGELES<|>Los Angeles hosted the Summer Olympics in 1984<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUMMER OLYMPICS 2028<|>LOS ANGELES<|>Los Angeles will host the Summer Olympics in 2028<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANK GEHRY<|>LOS ANGELES<|>Frank Gehry designed a significant portion of the architecture in Downtown Los Angeles<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
