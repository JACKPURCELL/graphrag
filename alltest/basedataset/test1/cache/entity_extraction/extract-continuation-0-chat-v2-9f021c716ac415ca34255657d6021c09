Its overseas regions and territories include French Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the North Atlantic, the French West Indies, and many islands in Oceania and the Indian Ocean, giving it one of the largest discontiguous exclusive economic zones in the world. Metropolitan France shares borders with Belgium and Luxembourg to the north, Germany to the northeast, Switzerland to the east, Italy and Monaco to the southeast, Andorra and Spain to the south, and a maritime border with the United Kingdom to the northwest. Its metropolitan area extends from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea. Its eighteen integral regions (five of which are overseas) span a combined area of 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi) and have a total population of 68.4 million as of January 2024.[6][8] France is a semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre.\n\nMetropolitan France was settled during the Iron Age by Celtic tribes known as Gauls before Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, leading to a distinct Gallo-Roman culture. In the Early Middle Ages, the Franks formed the Kingdom of Francia, which became the heartland of the Carolingian Empire. The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned the empire, with West Francia evolving into the Kingdom of France. In the High Middle Ages, France was a powerful but decentralized feudal kingdom, but from the mid-14th to the mid-15th centuries, France was plunged into a dynastic conflict with England known as the Hundred Years' War. In the 16th century, the French Renaissance saw culture flourish and a French colonial empire rise.[13] Internally, France was dominated by the conflict with the House of Habsburg and the French Wars of Religion between Catholics and Huguenots. France was successful in the Thirty Years' War and further increased its influence during the reign of Louis XIV.[14]\n\nThe French Revolution of 1789 overthrew the Ancien Régime and produced the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day. France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century under Napoleon Bonaparte, subjugating part of continental Europe and establishing the First French Empire. The collapse of the empire initiated a period of relative decline, in which France endured the Bourbon Restoration until the founding of the French Second Republic which was succeeded by the Second French Empire upon Napoleon III's takeover. His empire collapsed during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. This led to the establishment of the Third French Republic, and subsequent decades saw a period of economic prosperity and cultural and scientific flourishing known as the Belle Époque. France was one of the major participants of World War I, from which it emerged victorious at great human and economic cost. It was among the Allies of World War II, but it surrendered and was occupied in 1940. Following its liberation in 1944, the short-lived Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the defeat in the Algerian War. The current Fifth Republic was formed in 1958 by Charles de Gaulle. Algeria and most French colonies became independent in the 1960s, with the majority retaining close economic and military ties with France.\n\nFrance retains its centuries-long status as a global centre of art, science, and philosophy. It hosts the fourth-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is the world's leading tourist destination, receiving 100 million foreign visitors in 2023.[15] France is a developed country with a high nominal per capita income globally, and its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world. It is a great power,[16] being one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and an official nuclear-weapon state. France is a founding and leading member of the European Union and the eurozone,[17] as well as a member of the Group of Seven, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and Francophonie.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FRANCE<|>GEO<|>France, officially the French Republic, is a country located primarily in Western Europe with overseas regions and territories, known for its cultural and economic influence, and a major player in global politics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARIS<|>GEO<|>Paris is the capital and largest city of France, serving as the main cultural and commercial center of the country)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAPOLEON BONAPARTE<|>PERSON<|>Napoleon Bonaparte was a French military leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the Napoleonic Wars, establishing the First French Empire)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHARLES DE GAULLE<|>PERSON<|>Charles de Gaulle was a French army officer and statesman who led the Free French Forces during World War II and founded the Fifth Republic in 1958)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUNDRED YEARS' WAR<|>EVENT<|>The Hundred Years' War was a series of conflicts waged from 1337 to 1453 between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of France over succession to the French throne)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRENCH REVOLUTION<|>EVENT<|>The French Revolution was a period of radical social and political change in France from 1789 to 1799 that led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the rise of the French Republic)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORLD WAR I<|>EVENT<|>World War I was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 1914 to 1918, in which France was one of the major participants and emerged victorious)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORLD WAR II<|>EVENT<|>World War II was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, during which France was occupied by Germany in 1940 and later liberated in 1944)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALGERIAN WAR<|>EVENT<|>The Algerian War was a war between France and the Algerian National Liberation Front from 1954 to 1962, which led to Algeria gaining independence from France)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANCE<|>PARIS<|>Paris is the capital city of France and serves as its main cultural and commercial center<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANCE<|>NAPOLEON BONAPARTE<|>Napoleon Bonaparte led France to its political and military zenith in the early 19th century<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANCE<|>CHARLES DE GAULLE<|>Charles de Gaulle founded the Fifth Republic of France in 1958<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANCE<|>HUNDRED YEARS' WAR<|>France was a key participant in the Hundred Years' War against England<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANCE<|>FRENCH REVOLUTION<|>The French Revolution was a pivotal event in France's history that led to the overthrow of the monarchy<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANCE<|>WORLD WAR I<|>France was one of the major participants in World War I and emerged victorious<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANCE<|>WORLD WAR II<|>France was occupied during World War II and later liberated<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANCE<|>ALGERIAN WAR<|>The Algerian War led to Algeria gaining independence from France<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
