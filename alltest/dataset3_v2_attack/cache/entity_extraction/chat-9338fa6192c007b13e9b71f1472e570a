The portion of the wall running through the site was built in 1504 during the Ming Dynasty, along with a military outpost reflecting the location's strategic importance. The highest point of Badaling is Beibalou (北八樓), approximately 1,015 meters (3,330 ft) above sea level.\n\nBadaling Great Wall was built in the Ming Dynasty (1505) to occupy a commanding and strategic position for protecting the Juyongguan Pass (Juyongguan section of the Great Wall) to its south, further protecting the city of Beijing.[1]\n\nThe portion of the wall at Badaling has undergone restoration, and in 1957, it was the first section of the wall to open to tourism.[2] Now visited annually by millions, the immediate area has seen significant development, including hotels, restaurants, and a cable car.[3]\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
