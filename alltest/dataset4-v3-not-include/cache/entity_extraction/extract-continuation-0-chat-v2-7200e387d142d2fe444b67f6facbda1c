Opened on May 24, 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was the first fixed crossing of the East River. It was also the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time of its opening, with a main span of 1,595.5 feet (486.3 m) and a deck 127 ft (38.7 m) above mean high water. The span was originally called the New York and Brooklyn Bridge or the East River Bridge but was officially renamed the Brooklyn Bridge in 1915.\n\nProposals for a bridge connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn were first made in the early 19th century, which eventually led to the construction of the current span, designed by John A. Roebling. The project's chief engineer, his son Washington Roebling, contributed further design work, assisted by the latter's wife, Emily Warren Roebling. Construction started in 1870 and was overseen by the New York Bridge Company, which in turn was controlled by the Tammany Hall political machine. Numerous controversies and the novelty of the design prolonged the project over thirteen years. After opening, the Brooklyn Bridge underwent several reconfigurations, having carried horse-drawn vehicles and elevated railway lines until 1950. To alleviate increasing traffic flows, additional bridges and tunnels were built across the East River. Following gradual deterioration, the Brooklyn Bridge was renovated several times, including in the 1950s, 1980s, and 2010s.\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge is the southernmost of the four toll-free vehicular bridges connecting Manhattan Island and Long Island, with the Manhattan Bridge, the Williamsburg Bridge, and the Queensboro Bridge to the north. Only passenger vehicles and pedestrian and bicycle traffic are permitted. A major tourist attraction since its opening, the Brooklyn Bridge has become an icon of New York City. Over the years, the bridge has been used as the location of various stunts and performances, as well as several crimes and attacks. The Brooklyn Bridge is designated a National Historic Landmark, a New York City landmark, and a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BROOKLYN BRIDGE<|>EVENT<|>The Brooklyn Bridge is a hybrid cable-stayed/suspension bridge in New York City, spanning the East River between Manhattan and Brooklyn, opened on May 24, 1883, and is a major tourist attraction and icon of New York City.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>GEO<|>New York City is a major city in the United States where the Brooklyn Bridge is located, connecting the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHN AUGUSTUS ROEBLING<|>PERSON<|>John Augustus Roebling was the designer of the Brooklyn Bridge, contributing to its innovative design.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WASHINGTON ROEBLING<|>PERSON<|>Washington Roebling was the chief engineer of the Brooklyn Bridge and the son of John Augustus Roebling, who further contributed to the bridge's design.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMILY WARREN ROEBLING<|>PERSON<|>Emily Warren Roebling assisted her husband, Washington Roebling, in the design and construction of the Brooklyn Bridge.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK BRIDGE COMPANY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The New York Bridge Company oversaw the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge and was controlled by the Tammany Hall political machine.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHN AUGUSTUS ROEBLING<|>BROOKLYN BRIDGE<|>John Augustus Roebling was the designer of the Brooklyn Bridge, contributing to its construction and design<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WASHINGTON ROEBLING<|>BROOKLYN BRIDGE<|>Washington Roebling was the chief engineer of the Brooklyn Bridge and played a significant role in its design and construction<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMILY WARREN ROEBLING<|>BROOKLYN BRIDGE<|>Emily Warren Roebling assisted in the construction and design of the Brooklyn Bridge, supporting her husband Washington Roebling<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK BRIDGE COMPANY<|>BROOKLYN BRIDGE<|>The New York Bridge Company oversaw the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge, managing the project<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW YORK CITY<|>BROOKLYN BRIDGE<|>The Brooklyn Bridge is located in New York City, connecting the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn<|>10)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
