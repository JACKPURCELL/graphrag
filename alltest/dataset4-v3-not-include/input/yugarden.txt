Yu Garden[1] or Yuyuan Garden[2] (traditional Chinese: 豫園; simplified Chinese: 豫园; pinyin: Yù Yuán, Shanghainese Yuyoe Wu Chinese pronunciation: [ɦy²².ɦɥø⁵⁵], lit. Garden of Happiness[3]) is an extensive Chinese garden located beside the City God Temple in the northeast of the Old City of Shanghai at Huangpu District, Shanghai. It abuts the Yuyuan Tourist Mart, the Huxinting Teahouse and the Yu Garden Bazaar.[4]

This garden is accessible from the Shanghai Metro's Line 10 and Line 14 Yuyuan Garden station.[5]

Boasting over 40 scenic spots, including pavilions, rock formations, and ponds, it is now a key site under state-level protection.[6]

A centerpiece is the Exquisite Jade Rock (玉玲珑) a porous 3.3-m, 5-ton boulder. Rumours about its origin include the story that it was meant for the Huizong Emperor (Northern Song dynasty from 1100 to 1126 AD) the imperial garden in Bianjing, but was salvaged from the Huangpu River after the boat carrying it had sunk.[7][8]
