The major powers were divided into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. Significant roles were played by countries such as the United States, which joined the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor, as well as Canada, Spain, and Ireland. During the war, San Francisco served as a major port of embarkation for naval service members. The conflict saw the occupation of France by Germany in 1940, with liberation occurring in 1944.
