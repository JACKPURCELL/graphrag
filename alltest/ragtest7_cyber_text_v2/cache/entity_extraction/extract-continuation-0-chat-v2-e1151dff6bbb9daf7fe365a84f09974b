Private WHOIS services display alternative information, such as their own company data, rather than the owner of the domain. Adversaries may use such private WHOIS services to obscure information about who owns a purchased domain. Adversaries may further interrupt efforts to track their infrastructure by using varied registration information and purchasing domains with different domain registrars.(Citation: Mandiant APT1)\nPlatforms: PRE\n\nAttack technique name: Botnet\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may buy, lease, or rent a network of compromised systems that can be used during targeting. A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be instructed to perform coordinated tasks.(Citation: Norton Botnet) Adversaries may purchase a subscription to use an existing botnet from a booter/stresser service. With a botnet at their disposal, adversaries may perform follow-on activity such as large-scale [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).(Citation: Imperva DDoS for Hire)(Citation: Krebs-Anna)(Citation: Krebs-Bazaar)(Citation: Krebs-Booter)\nPlatforms: PRE\n\nAttack technique name: Server\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may buy, lease, rent, or obtain physical servers that can be used during targeting. Use of servers allows an adversary to stage, launch, and execute an operation. During post-compromise activity, adversaries may utilize servers for various tasks, such as watering hole operations in [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189), enabling [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) operations, or facilitating [Command and Control](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011). Instead of compromising a third-party [Server](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/004) or renting a [Virtual Private Server](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/003), adversaries may opt to configure and run their own servers in support of operations. Free trial periods of cloud servers may also be abused.(Citation: Free Trial PurpleUrchin)(Citation: Freejacked) \n\nAdversaries may only need a lightweight setup if most of their activities will take place using online infrastructure. Or, they may need to build extensive infrastructure if they want to test, communicate, and control other aspects of their activities on their own systems.(Citation: NYTStuxnet)\nPlatforms: PRE\n\nAttack technique name: DNS Server\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may set up their own Domain Name System (DNS) servers that can be used during targeting. During post-compromise activity, adversaries may utilize DNS traffic for various tasks, including for Command and Control (ex: [Application Layer Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071)). Instead of hijacking existing DNS servers, adversaries may opt to configure and run their own DNS servers in support of operations.\n\nBy running their own DNS servers, adversaries can have more control over how they administer server-side DNS C2 traffic ([DNS](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/004)). With control over a DNS server, adversaries can configure DNS applications to provide conditional responses to malware and, generally, have more flexibility in the structure of the DNS-based C2 channel.(Citation: Unit42 DNS Mar 2019)\nPlatforms: PRE\n\nAttack technique name: Virtual Private Server\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may rent Virtual Private Servers (VPSs) that can be used during targeting. There exist a variety of cloud service providers that will sell virtual machines/containers as a service. By utilizing a VPS, adversaries can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to them. The use of cloud infrastructure can also make it easier for adversaries to rapidly provision, modify, and shut down their infrastructure.\n\nAcquiring a VPS for use in later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as Command and Control, can allow adversaries to benefit from the ubiquity and trust associated with higher reputation cloud service providers. Adversaries may also acquire infrastructure from VPS service providers that are known for renting VPSs with minimal registration information, allowing for more anonymous acquisitions of infrastructure.(Citation: TrendmicroHideoutsLease)\nPlatforms: PRE\n\nAttack technique name: Serverless\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may purchase and configure serverless cloud infrastructure, such as Cloudflare Workers or AWS Lambda functions, that can be used during targeting. By utilizing serverless infrastructure, adversaries can make it more difficult to attribute infrastructure used during operations back to them.\n\nOnce acquired, the serverless runtime environment can be leveraged to either respond directly to infected machines or to [Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090) traffic to an adversary-owned command and control server.(Citation: BlackWater Malware Cloudflare Workers)(Citation: AWS Lambda Redirector) As traffic generated by these functions will appear to come from subdomains of common cloud providers, it\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HTTRACK_UNHCR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HTTrack UNHCR is a tool or organization referenced in the context of phishing and malicious content delivery.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MALICIOUS CONTENT<|>EVENT<|>Malicious content refers to harmful software or links that are designed to deceive or harm users.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOMAIN REGISTRARS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Domain registrars are companies that manage the reservation of Internet domain names and maintain a publicly viewable database of registered domains.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHOIS SERVICES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>WHOIS services provide information about the registered owners of domain names, often obscuring the actual owner's details for privacy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOTNET<|>EVENT<|>A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be used for coordinated malicious activities, such as phishing or DDoS attacks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVER<|>EVENT<|>Servers are physical or virtual machines used by adversaries to stage and execute operations during cyber attacks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DNS SERVER<|>EVENT<|>DNS servers translate domain names into IP addresses and can be used by adversaries for command and control during cyber operations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIRTUAL PRIVATE SERVER<|>EVENT<|>Virtual Private Servers (VPS) are cloud-based servers that adversaries can rent to obscure their operations and maintain anonymity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVERLESS<|>EVENT<|>Serverless infrastructure allows adversaries to run applications without managing servers, making it harder to trace their activities.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HTTRACK_UNHCR<|>MALICIOUS CONTENT<|>HTTrack UNHCR is associated with the delivery of malicious content through phishing techniques<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOMAIN REGISTRARS<|>WHOIS SERVICES<|>Domain registrars work with WHOIS services to provide information about domain ownership<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOTNET<|>SERVER<|>Botnets utilize servers to execute coordinated attacks and manage compromised systems<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DNS SERVER<|>BOTNET<|>Adversaries may use DNS servers to control botnets and manage command and control traffic<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VIRTUAL PRIVATE SERVER<|>BOTNET<|>Adversaries may rent VPSs to host botnets and conduct operations anonymously<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SERVERLESS<|>BOTNET<|>Serverless infrastructure can be used to support botnet operations without revealing the adversary's identity<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
