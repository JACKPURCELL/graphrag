When a user logs out or restarts via the macOS Graphical User Interface (GUI), a prompt is provided to the user with a checkbox to \"Reopen windows when logging back in\".(Citation: Re-Open windows on Mac) When selected, all applications currently open are added to a property list file named <code>com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist</code> within the <code>~/Library/Preferences/ByHost</code> directory.(Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence)(Citation: Wardle Persistence Chapter) Applications listed in this file are automatically reopened upon the userâ€™s next logon.\n\nAdversaries can establish [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003) by adding a malicious application path to the <code>com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist</code> file to execute payloads when a user logs in.\nPlatforms: macOS\n\nAttack technique name: Winlogon Helper DLL\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may abuse features of Winlogon to execute DLLs and/or executables when a user logs in. Winlogon.exe is a Windows component responsible for actions at logon/logoff as well as the secure attention sequence (SAS) triggered by Ctrl-Alt-Delete. Registry entries in <code>HKLM\\Software[\\\\Wow6432Node\\\\]\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\</code> and <code>HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\</code> are used to manage additional helper programs and functionalities that support Winlogon.(Citation: Cylance Reg Persistence Sept 2013) \n\nMalicious modifications to these Registry keys may cause Winlogon to load and execute malicious DLLs and/or executables. Specifically, the following subkeys have been known to be possibly vulnerable to abuse: (Citation: Cylance Reg Persistence Sept 2013)\n\n* Winlogon\\Notify - points to notification package DLLs that handle Winlogon events\n* Winlogon\\Userinit - points to userinit.exe, the user initialization program executed when a user logs on\n* Winlogon\\Shell - points to explorer.exe, the system shell executed when a user logs on\n\nAdversaries may take advantage of these features to repeatedly execute malicious code and establish persistence.\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Security Support Provider\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may abuse security support providers (SSPs) to execute DLLs when the system boots. Windows SSP DLLs are loaded into the Local Security Authority (LSA) process at system start. Once loaded into the LSA, SSP DLLs have access to encrypted and plaintext passwords that are stored in Windows, such as any logged-on user's Domain password or smart card PINs.\n\nThe SSP configuration is stored in two Registry keys: <code>HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\\Security Packages</code> and <code>HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\\OSConfig\\Security Packages</code>. An adversary may modify these Registry keys to add new SSPs, which will be loaded the next time the system boots, or when the AddSecurityPackage Windows API function is called.(Citation: Graeber 2014)\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a program to a startup folder or referencing it with a Registry run key. Adding an entry to the \"run keys\" in the Registry or startup folder will cause the program referenced to be executed when a user logs in.(Citation: Microsoft Run Key) These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.\n\nThe following run keys are created by default on Windows systems:\n\n* <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run</code>\n* <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce</code>\n* <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run</code>\n* <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce</code>\n\nRun keys may exist under multiple hives.(Citation: Microsoft Wow6432Node 2018)(Citation: Malwarebytes Wow6432Node 2016) The <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnceEx</code> is also available but is not created by default on Windows Vista and newer. Registry run key entries can reference programs directly or list them as a dependency.(Citation: Microsoft Run Key) For example, it is possible to load a DLL at logon using a \"Depend\" key with RunOnceEx: <code>reg add HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnceEx\\0001\\Depend /v 1 /d \"C:\\temp\\evil[.]dll\"</code> (Citation: Oddvar Moe RunOnceEx Mar 2018)\n\nPlacing a program within a startup folder will also cause that program to execute when a user logs in. There is a startup folder location for individual user accounts as well as a system-wide startup folder\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CROWDSTRIKE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity technology company known for its endpoint protection and threat intelligence services.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GITHUB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration, allowing developers to work together on projects from anywhere.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RSAC 2015<|>EVENT<|>RSAC 2015 is a cybersecurity conference held in San Francisco, featuring discussions on security topics and innovations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECURELIST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Securelist is a cybersecurity research and analysis platform that provides insights into malware and cyber threats.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TREND MICRO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Trend Micro is a global cybersecurity company that provides security software and solutions for businesses and consumers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>GEO<|>Linux is an open-source operating system kernel that is widely used in various distributions for servers, desktops, and embedded systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>GEO<|>macOS is an operating system developed by Apple Inc. for its line of Mac computers, known for its user-friendly interface and robust security features.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>GEO<|>Windows is a series of operating systems developed by Microsoft, widely used in personal computers and enterprise environments.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CROWDSTRIKE<|>RSAC 2015<|>CrowdStrike likely participated in RSAC 2015 to showcase its cybersecurity solutions and engage with industry professionals<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GITHUB<|>CROWDSTRIKE<|>CrowdStrike may utilize GitHub for version control and collaboration on its software development projects<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TREND MICRO<|>SECURELIST<|>Trend Micro may reference Securelist for threat intelligence and research on malware trends<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINUX<|>CROWDSTRIKE<|>CrowdStrike provides security solutions that are compatible with Linux operating systems<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MACOS<|>CROWDSTRIKE<|>CrowdStrike offers security solutions for macOS to protect against malware and cyber threats<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINDOWS<|>CROWDSTRIKE<|>CrowdStrike provides security solutions for Windows operating systems to protect against malware and cyber threats<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
