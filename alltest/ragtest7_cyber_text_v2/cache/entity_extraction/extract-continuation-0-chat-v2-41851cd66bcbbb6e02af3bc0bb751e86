The format of each attack technique's information is as follows:\nAttack technique name: ***\nAttack technique description: ***\nPlatforms: ***\nThese respectively represent the name of the attack technique, a detailed description, and the platforms it can target.\n\nAttack technique name: Hide Artifacts\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may attempt to hide artifacts associated with their behaviors to evade detection. Operating systems may have features to hide various artifacts, such as important system files and administrative task execution, to avoid disrupting user work environments and prevent users from changing files or features on the system. Adversaries may abuse these features to hide artifacts such as files, directories, user accounts, or other system activity to evade detection.(Citation: Sofacy Komplex Trojan)(Citation: Cybereason OSX Pirrit)(Citation: MalwareBytes ADS July 2015)\n\nAdversaries may also attempt to hide artifacts associated with malicious behavior by creating computing regions that are isolated from common security instrumentation, such as through the use of virtualization technology.(Citation: Sophos Ragnar May 2020)\nPlatforms: Linux, macOS, Windows, Office 365\n\nAttack technique name: Hidden Window\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may use hidden windows to conceal malicious activity from the plain sight of users. In some cases, windows that would typically be displayed when an application carries out an operation can be hidden. This may be utilized by system administrators to avoid disrupting user work environments when carrying out administrative tasks. \n\nAdversaries may abuse these functionalities to hide otherwise visible windows from users so as not to alert the user to adversary activity on the system.(Citation: Antiquated Mac Malware)\n\nOn macOS, the configurations for how applications run are listed in property list (plist) files. One of the tags in these files can be <code>apple.awt.UIElement</code>, which allows for Java applications to prevent the application's icon from appearing in the Dock. A common use for this is when applications run in the system tray, but don't also want to show up in the Dock.\n\nSimilarly, on Windows there are a variety of features in scripting languages, such as [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001), Jscript, and [Visual Basic](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/005) to make windows hidden. One example of this is <code>powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden</code>.(Citation: PowerShell About 2019)\n\nIn addition, Windows supports the `CreateDesktop()` API that can create a hidden desktop window with its own corresponding <code>explorer.exe</code> process.(Citation: Hidden VNC)(Citation: Anatomy of an hVNC Attack)  All applications running on the hidden desktop window, such as a hidden VNC (hVNC) session,(Citation: Hidden VNC) will be invisible to other desktops windows.\nPlatforms: macOS, Windows, Linux\n\nAttack technique name: Ignore Process Interrupts\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may evade defensive mechanisms by executing commands that hide from process interrupt signals. Many operating systems use signals to deliver messages to control process behavior. Command interpreters often include specific commands/flags that ignore errors and other hangups, such as when the user of the active session logs off.(Citation: Linux Signal Man)  These interrupt signals may also be used by defensive tools and/or analysts to pause or terminate specified running processes. \n\nAdversaries may invoke processes using `nohup`, [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) `-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`, or similar commands that may be immune to hangups.(Citation: nohup Linux Man)(Citation: Microsoft PowerShell SilentlyContinue) This may enable malicious commands and malware to continue execution through system events that would otherwise terminate its execution, such as users logging off or the termination of its C2 network connection.\n\nHiding from process interrupt signals may allow malware to continue execution, but unlike [Trap](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/005) this does not establish [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003) since the process will not be re-invoked once actually terminated.\nPlatforms: Linux, macOS, Windows\n\nAttack technique name: Hidden Users\nAttack technique description: Adversaries may use hidden users to hide the presence of user accounts they create or modify. Administrators may want to hide users when there are many user accounts on a given system or if they want to hide their administrative or other management accounts from other users. \n\nIn macOS, adversaries can create or modify a user to be hidden through manipulating plist files, folder attributes, and user attributes. To prevent a user from being shown on the login screen and in System Preferences, adversaries can set the userID to be under 500 and set the key value <code>Hide500Users</code> to <code>TRUE</code> in the <code>/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow</code> plist file.(Citation: Cybereason OSX Pirrit) Every user has a userID associated with it. When the <code>Hide500Users</code> key value is set to <code>TRUE</code>, users with a userID under 500 do not appear on the login screen and in System Preferences\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HIDE ARTIFACTS<|>EVENT<|>Hide Artifacts is an attack technique where adversaries attempt to conceal artifacts associated with their behaviors to evade detection in operating systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIDDEN WINDOW<|>EVENT<|>Hidden Window is an attack technique where adversaries use hidden windows to conceal malicious activity from users.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IGNORE PROCESS INTERRUPTS<|>EVENT<|>Ignore Process Interrupts is an attack technique that allows adversaries to evade defensive mechanisms by executing commands that hide from process interrupt signals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIDDEN USERS<|>EVENT<|>Hidden Users is an attack technique where adversaries hide the presence of user accounts they create or modify to avoid detection.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FILE/PATH EXCLUSIONS<|>EVENT<|>File/Path Exclusions is an attack technique that involves excluding certain files or paths from being monitored or scanned by security tools.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMAIL HIDING RULES<|>EVENT<|>Email Hiding Rules is an attack technique that allows adversaries to conceal email communications from detection.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESOURCE FORKING<|>EVENT<|>Resource Forking is an attack technique where adversaries create additional data streams to hide malicious content.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUN VIRTUAL INSTANCE<|>EVENT<|>Run Virtual Instance is an attack technique that involves using virtualization technology to isolate malicious activities from detection.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROCESS ARGUMENT SPOOFING<|>EVENT<|>Process Argument Spoofing is an attack technique where adversaries manipulate process arguments to mislead security tools.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIDDEN FILES AND DIRECTORIES<|>EVENT<|>Hidden Files and Directories is an attack technique that involves concealing files and directories to evade detection.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NTFS FILE ATTRIBUTES<|>EVENT<|>NTFS File Attributes is an attack technique that allows adversaries to manipulate file attributes to hide malicious files.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VBA STOMPING<|>EVENT<|>VBA Stomping is an attack technique where adversaries modify or delete VBA code to hide malicious behavior in documents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIDDEN FILE SYSTEM<|>EVENT<|>Hidden File System is an attack technique that involves creating a file system that is not visible to standard file browsing tools.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HIDE ARTIFACTS<|>HIDDEN WINDOW<|>Both techniques involve concealing activities to evade detection, with Hide Artifacts focusing on system files and Hidden Window on user-visible windows.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HIDE ARTIFACTS<|>IGNORE PROCESS INTERRUPTS<|>Both techniques are used by adversaries to maintain malicious activities without being interrupted by system defenses.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HIDDEN USERS<|>HIDE ARTIFACTS<|>Both techniques are aimed at hiding elements from detection, with Hidden Users focusing on user accounts and Hide Artifacts on system files.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HIDDEN WINDOW<|>RUN VIRTUAL INSTANCE<|>Both techniques involve hiding activities from users, with Hidden Window focusing on application windows and Run Virtual Instance on virtual environments.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IGNORE PROCESS INTERRUPTS<|>HIDDEN USERS<|>Both techniques allow adversaries to maintain control over their activities without being detected, with Ignore Process Interrupts focusing on process behavior and Hidden Users on user accounts.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HIDDEN FILES AND DIRECTORIES<|>HIDE ARTIFACTS<|>Both techniques involve hiding elements from detection, with Hidden Files and Directories focusing on file visibility and Hide Artifacts on system behaviors.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HIDDEN FILE SYSTEM<|>HIDE ARTIFACTS<|>Both techniques are used to conceal malicious activities, with Hidden File System focusing on file systems and Hide Artifacts on various system elements.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
