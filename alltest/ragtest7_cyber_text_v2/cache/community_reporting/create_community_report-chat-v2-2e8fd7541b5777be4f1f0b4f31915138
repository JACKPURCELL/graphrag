This capability allows adversaries to conduct operations covertly, making it difficult for security measures to detect and mitigate their activities. The serverless nature of AWS Lambda means that users do not need to manage servers, which can be advantageous for malicious actors seeking to obscure their identity and location while executing harmful code.
