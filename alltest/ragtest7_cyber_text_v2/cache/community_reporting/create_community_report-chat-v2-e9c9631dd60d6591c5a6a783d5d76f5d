It is the primary file system used for managing files and directories, which makes it essential for the functionality of Windows. The widespread use of NTFS across various Windows versions highlights its significance in the computing environment.

This capability can be used for legitimate purposes, such as storing metadata, but it also raises security concerns as it can be exploited to hide malicious data. The relationship between NTFS and ADS indicates that while ADS can enhance data management, it also poses risks that need to be managed effectively.
