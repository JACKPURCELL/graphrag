Each of these techniques poses unique risks to cloud environments, allowing adversaries to manipulate resources, evade detection, and maintain unauthorized access. For instance, 'Modify Cloud Compute Configurations' and 'Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure' are closely related, as altering configurations is essential for executing broader infrastructure manipulations [Data: Entities (362, 357, 359, 361, 358, 360)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Mitigation methods are crucial for defense\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Mitigation methods such as User Account Management and Audit play a vital role in defending against the attack techniques identified in this community.
