{"result": "Serverless refers to a cloud computing model that enables the execution of applications without the need for server management. This infrastructure allows adversaries to run their applications in a way that makes it more challenging to trace their activities. As an attack technique, serverless can be exploited by adversaries who utilize cloud services to execute code without managing servers. To counteract this threat, specific mitigation methods are necessary to prevent initial access by these adversaries.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
