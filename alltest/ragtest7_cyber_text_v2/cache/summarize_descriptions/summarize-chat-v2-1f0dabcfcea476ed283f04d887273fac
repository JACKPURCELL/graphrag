{"result": "External Remote Services is a technique utilized by adversaries to gain unauthorized access to hosts and networks remotely. This method often involves exploiting vulnerabilities in external-facing remote services, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and Citrix. By leveraging these services, adversaries can not only access systems but also establish persistence within a network, thereby enhancing their ability to conduct further malicious activities. Overall, External Remote Services encompass various services that facilitate remote access, making them potential targets for exploitation by malicious actors.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
