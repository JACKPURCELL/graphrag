Reconnaissance is a critical and preparatory step that adversaries undertake to achieve initial access. It involves gathering information about a target, which can significantly facilitate the process of gaining initial access. This technique is essential for adversaries, as it allows them to identify vulnerabilities and plan their attacks effectively. If not properly mitigated, reconnaissance can lead to successful initial access, making it a vital phase in the overall attack strategy. Thus, reconnaissance occurs prior to and is instrumental in enabling initial access by adversaries.</data>
