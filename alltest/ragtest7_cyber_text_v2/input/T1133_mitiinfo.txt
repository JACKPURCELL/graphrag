There are 4 mitigation methods that can mitigating the attack technique called External Remote Services. Their names are as follows:
* Network Segmentation 
* Disable or Remove Feature or Program 
* Limit Access to Resource Over Network 
* Multi-factor Authentication 

The following content describes information about mitigation methods. The format of each mitigation method's information is as follows:
Mitigation method name: ***
Mitigation method description: ***
These respectively represent the name of the mitigation method and a detailed description of how it works.

Mitigation method name: Network Segmentation
Mitigation method description: Architect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use a DMZ to contain any internet-facing services that should not be exposed from the internal network. Configure separate virtual private cloud (VPC) instances to isolate critical cloud systems.

Mitigation method name: Disable or Remove Feature or Program
Mitigation method description: Remove or deny access to unnecessary and potentially vulnerable software to prevent abuse by adversaries.

Mitigation method name: Limit Access to Resource Over Network
Mitigation method description: Prevent access to file shares, remote access to systems, unnecessary services. Mechanisms to limit access may include use of network concentrators, RDP gateways, etc.

Mitigation method name: Multi-factor Authentication
Mitigation method description: Use two or more pieces of evidence to authenticate to a system; such as username and password in addition to a token from a physical smart card or token generator.
