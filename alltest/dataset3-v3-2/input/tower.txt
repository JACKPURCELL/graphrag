Shanghai Tower (Chinese: 上海中心大厦; pinyin: Shànghǎi Zhōngxīn Dàshà; Shanghainese: Zånhe Tsonsin Dusa; lit. 'Shanghai Center Building') is a 128-story, 632-meter-tall (2,073 ft) megatall skyscraper located in Lujiazui, Pudong, Shanghai.[10] It is the tallest building in China and the world's third-tallest building by height to architectural top. It is the tallest and largest LEED Platinum certified building in the world since 2015. It had the world's fastest elevators at a top speed of 20.5 meters per second (74 km/h; 46 mph) until 2017,[11][12] when it was surpassed by the Guangzhou CTF Finance Center, with its top speed of 21 meters per second (76 km/h; 47 mph).[13] Designed by the international design firm Gensler and owned by the Shanghai Municipal Government,[2] it is the tallest of the world's first triple-adjacent supertall buildings in Pudong, the other two being the Jin Mao Tower and the Shanghai World Financial Center. Its tiered construction, designed for high energy efficiency, provides nine separate zones divided between office, retail and leisure use.[5][7][14] The US-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat cites it as "one of the most sustainably advanced tall buildings in the world."[15]

Groundbreaking and construction work on the tower began on 29 November 2008 and topped out on 4 August 2013.[10][16] The exterior was completed in summer 2015,[8][14] and work was considered complete in September 2014. Although the building was originally scheduled to open to the public in November 2014, the actual public-use date was shifted to February 2015. The observation deck was opened to visitors in July 2016; the period from July through September 2018 was termed a "test run" or "commissioning" period.[17][18] Since April 26, 2017, the sightseeing decks on the 118th and 119th floors (546m and 547m high respectively) has been fully open to the public.[19] By 2020, the opening of a further deck, dubbed the "Top of Shanghai" on the 121th floor at 562m (1844 ft), made it the highest observation deck in the world, beating out the Burj Khalifa's observation deck at 555m (1823 ft).[20] The J Hotel Shanghai Tower, opened on the 120th floor in 2021, became the world's highest luxury hotel.[21][22]
