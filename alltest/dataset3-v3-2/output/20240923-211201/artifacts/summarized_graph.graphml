It is located at the southern tip of New York State, situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors. The city comprises five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island. New York City is renowned for its iconic skyline and significant landmarks, including Central Park, the Empire State Building, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Times Square, and the Statue of Liberty located on Liberty Island.

The city serves as a global hub for finance, commerce, art, and entertainment, and is known for its cultural diversity, being the most linguistically diverse city in the world with a substantial foreign-born population.
