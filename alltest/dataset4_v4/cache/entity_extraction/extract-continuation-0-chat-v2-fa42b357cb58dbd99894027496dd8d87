It is located on Capitol Hill at the eastern end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Although no longer at the geographic center of the national capital, the U.S. Capitol forms the origin point for the street-numbering system of the district as well as its four quadrants. Like the principal buildings of the executive and judicial branches, the Capitol is built in a neoclassical style and has a white exterior.\n\nCentral sections of the present building were completed in 1800. These were partly destroyed in the 1814 Burning of Washington, then were fully restored within five years. The building was enlarged in the 1850s by extending the wings for the chambers for the bicameral legislature, the House of Representatives in the south wing and the Senate in the north wing. The massive dome was completed around 1866 just after the American Civil War. The east front portico was extended in 1958. The building's Visitors Center was opened in the early 21st century.\n\nBoth its east and west elevations are formally referred to as fronts, although only the east front was intended for the reception of visitors and dignitaries, while the west front is now used for presidential inauguration ceremonies. The building and grounds are overseen by the Architect of the Capitol, who also oversees the surrounding Capitol Complex.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES CAPITOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The United States Capitol is the seat of the United States Congress, located on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., and serves as the legislative branch of the federal government.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WASHINGTON, D.C.<|>GEO<|>Washington, D.C. is the capital city of the United States, where the United States Capitol is located.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAPITOL HILL<|>GEO<|>Capitol Hill is the neighborhood in Washington, D.C. where the United States Capitol is situated.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BURNING OF WASHINGTON<|>EVENT<|>The Burning of Washington was an event in 1814 during the War of 1812 when British forces captured and burned several government buildings in Washington, D.C., including the Capitol.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED STATES CAPITOL<|>WASHINGTON, D.C.<|>The United States Capitol is located in Washington, D.C., which is the capital of the United States.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED STATES CAPITOL<|>CAPITOL HILL<|>The United States Capitol is situated on Capitol Hill, a neighborhood in Washington, D.C.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED STATES CAPITOL<|>BURNING OF WASHINGTON<|>The United States Capitol was partly destroyed during the Burning of Washington in 1814.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
