It is best known for its consumer electronics, software, and services. Apple's product lineup includes include the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Vision Pro, and Apple TV; as well as software like iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS; and services like Apple Card, Apple Pay, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.\n\nSince 2011, Apple has been the world's largest company by market capitalization except when Microsoft held the position between January and June 2024.[6][7][8] In 2022, Apple was the largest technology company by revenue, with US$394.3 billion.[9][failed verification] As of 2023, Apple was the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales,[10] the largest manufacturing company by revenue, and the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world.[11] It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon, Meta (the parent company of Facebook), and Microsoft.\n\nApple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, to produce and market Steve Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. The company was incorporated by Wozniak and Steve Jobs in 1977. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, the company's internal problems included the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives. That year Jobs left Apple to form NeXT, Inc., and Wozniak withdrew to other ventures. The market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, and Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced Wintel duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones.\n\nIn 1997, Apple was weeks away from bankruptcy. To resolve its failed operating system strategy and entice Jobs's return, it bought NeXT. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through several tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the \"Think different\" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden its product portfolio. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later. He was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.\n\nApple has received criticism regarding its contractors' labor practices, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, it has a large following and a high level of brand loyalty. It has been consistently ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.\n\nApple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, $2 trillion in August 2020, and at $3 trillion in January 2022. As of June 2024, it was valued at just over $3.2 trillion.[8]\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>APPLE INC.<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apple Inc. is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Cupertino, California, known for its consumer electronics, software, and services, including products like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and services like Apple Pay and iCloud.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUPERTINO<|>GEO<|>Cupertino is a city in California, known as the headquarters of Apple Inc.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALIFORNIA<|>GEO<|>California is a U.S. state where Apple Inc. is headquartered in Cupertino.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEVE JOBS<|>PERSON<|>Steve Jobs was a co-founder of Apple Inc. and served as its CEO until his resignation in 2011 due to health issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIM COOK<|>PERSON<|>Tim Cook succeeded Steve Jobs as CEO of Apple Inc. in 2011.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEXT, INC.<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NeXT, Inc. was a company founded by Steve Jobs after leaving Apple, which was later acquired by Apple to facilitate Jobs's return.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IPHONE<|>EVENT<|>The iPhone is one of Apple's flagship products, a smartphone that has significantly impacted the mobile phone market.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IPAD<|>EVENT<|>The iPad is a tablet computer developed by Apple Inc., known for its user-friendly interface and versatility.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IMAC<|>EVENT<|>The iMac is a line of all-in-one desktop computers designed by Apple, known for its sleek design and powerful performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IPOD<|>EVENT<|>The iPod is a portable media player developed by Apple, which revolutionized the way music is consumed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLE STORE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Apple Store is a retail chain owned by Apple Inc. that sells Apple products and provides customer support.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEVE JOBS<|>APPLE INC.<|>Steve Jobs co-founded Apple Inc. and played a crucial role in its development and success until his resignation in 2011<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TIM COOK<|>APPLE INC.<|>Tim Cook succeeded Steve Jobs as CEO of Apple Inc. and has continued to lead the company since 2011<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEXT, INC.<|>APPLE INC.<|>Apple Inc. acquired NeXT, Inc. to bring back Steve Jobs and resolve its operating system issues<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE INC.<|>CUPERTINO<|>Apple Inc. is headquartered in Cupertino, California<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE INC.<|>CALIFORNIA<|>Apple Inc. is based in California, which is the state of its headquarters<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE INC.<|>IPHONE<|>The iPhone is one of the flagship products developed and marketed by Apple Inc.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE INC.<|>IPAD<|>The iPad is another flagship product developed and marketed by Apple Inc.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE INC.<|>IMAC<|>The iMac is a product line developed by Apple Inc. known for its design and performance<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE INC.<|>IPOD<|>The iPod is a product developed by Apple Inc. that changed the music industry<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE STORE<|>APPLE INC.<|>The Apple Store is a retail chain owned by Apple Inc. that sells its products<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
