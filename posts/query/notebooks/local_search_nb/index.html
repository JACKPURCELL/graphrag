<h2>Local Search Example</h2>
<p>Local search method generates answers by combining relevant data from the AI-extracted knowledge-graph with text chunks of the raw documents. This method is suitable for questions that require an understanding of specific entities mentioned in the documents (e.g. What are the healing properties of chamomile?).</p>
<h3>Load text units and graph data tables as context for local search</h3>
<ul>
<li>In this test we first load indexing outputs from parquet files to dataframes, then convert these dataframes into collections of data objects aligning with the knowledge model.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Load tables to dataframes</h3>

<p># Overview of Paris</p>
<p>Paris, the capital and largest city of France, is a global hub renowned for its significant roles in finance, diplomacy, commerce, culture, fashion, and gastronomy. Often referred to as the &quot;City of Light,&quot; Paris has been a major center for arts and sciences since the 17th century. The city is the heart of the Île-de-France region, which is the most populous region in France and a major economic powerhouse within the European Union [Data: Entities (92); Relationships (119, 135)].</p>
<p>## Cultural Significance</p>
<p>Paris is home to some of the world's most famous cultural institutions. The Louvre, the most-visited art museum globally, and the Musée d'Orsay, known for its French Impressionist art collection, are key attractions that contribute to Paris's reputation as a cultural capital. Other notable museums include the Pompidou Centre, Musée Picasso, and Musée Marmottan Monet, which are celebrated for their collections of modern and contemporary art [Data: Entities (98, 99, 102, 104, 100); Relationships (140, 141, 144, 146, 142, +more)].</p>
<p>## Economic and Political Influence</p>
<p>As the center of the Île-de-France region, Paris is an economic powerhouse, hosting significant financial institutions such as the European Banking Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority. These entities underscore Paris's role in financial regulation and economic governance within the European Union [Data: Entities (111, 112); Relationships (153, 154)]. Additionally, Paris hosts several key international organizations, including UNESCO, the OECD, and the International Energy Agency, which play pivotal roles in global policy-making and international cooperation [Data: Entities (49, 105, 108); Relationships (85, 147, 150)].</p>
<p>## Transportation Hub</p>
<p>Paris is a critical transportation hub in Europe, with Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports serving as major international gateways. The Paris Métro, one of the busiest subway systems in Europe, further underscores the city's importance in facilitating regional and international travel. Gare du Nord, a major railway station, is the busiest station outside Japan, highlighting Paris's role in global connectivity [Data: Entities (94, 95, 96, 97); Relationships (136, 137, 138, 139)].</p>
<p>## Sporting Legacy</p>
<p>Paris has a rich history of hosting major international sporting events, including the Summer Olympics, FIFA World Cup, and the Tour de France. These events not only boost the city's global profile but also contribute to its economy through tourism and international media coverage. The French Open, an annual Grand Slam tennis tournament, is held at Roland Garros in Paris, further cementing the city's status as a sporting hub [Data: Entities (117, 116, 124); Relationships (159, 160, 164, 158, 166)].</p>
