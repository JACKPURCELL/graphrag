With an official estimated population of 2,102,650 residents in January 2023[2] in an area of more than 105 km2 (41 sq mi),[5] Paris is the fourth-largest city in the European Union and the 30th most densely populated city in the world in 2022.[6] Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, culture, fashion, and gastronomy. For its leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its early and extensive system of street lighting, in the 19th century, it became known as the City of Light.[7]\n\nThe City of Paris is the centre of the \u00cele-de-France region, or Paris Region, with an official estimated population of 12,271,794 inhabitants in January 2023, or about 19% of the population of France.[2] The Paris Region had a GDP of \u20ac765 billion (US$1.064 trillion, PPP)[8] in 2021, the highest in the European Union.[9] According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey, in 2022, Paris was the city with the ninth-highest cost of living in the world.[10]\n\nParis is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served by two international airports: Charles de Gaulle Airport, the third-busiest airport in Europe, and Orly Airport.[11][12] Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris M\u00e9tro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily.[13] It is the second-busiest metro system in Europe after the Moscow Metro. Gare du Nord is the 24th-busiest railway station in the world and the busiest outside Japan, with 262 million passengers in 2015.[14] Paris has one of the most sustainable transportation systems[15] and is one of only two cities in the world that received the Sustainable Transport Award twice.[16]\n\nParis is known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the Louvre received 8.9 million visitors in 2023, on track for keeping its position as the most-visited art museum in the world.[17] The Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet and Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist art. The Pompidou Centre Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne, Mus\u00e9e Rodin and Mus\u00e9e Picasso are noted for their collections of modern and contemporary art. The historical district along the Seine in the city centre has been classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1991.[18]\n\nParis is home to several United Nations organizations including UNESCO, as well as other international organizations such as the OECD, the OECD Development Centre, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, the International Energy Agency, the International Federation for Human Rights, along with European bodies such as the European Space Agency, the European Banking Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority. The football club Paris Saint-Germain and the rugby union club Stade Fran\u00e7ais are based in Paris. The 81,000-seat Stade de France, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of Paris in the neighbouring commune of Saint-Denis. Paris hosts the annual French Open Grand Slam tennis tournament on the red clay of Roland Garros. Paris hosted the Olympic Games in 1900 and 1924 and is currently hosting the 2024 Summer Olympics. The 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups, the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, the 2007 Rugby World Cup, as well as the 1960, 1984 and 2016 UEFA European Championships were held in Paris. Every July, the Tour de France bicycle race finishes on the Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PARIS<|>GEO<|>Paris is the capital and largest city of France, known for its significant role in finance, culture, and the arts, and is a major transportation hub with a rich history and numerous landmarks.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>\u00ceLE-DE-FRANCE<|>GEO<|>\u00cele-de-France is the region surrounding Paris, which includes the city and has a large population and significant economic output.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Charles de Gaulle Airport is the third-busiest airport in Europe, serving as a major international gateway to Paris.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORLY AIRPORT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Orly Airport is one of the two international airports serving Paris, facilitating air transport for millions of passengers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARIS M\u00c9TRO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Paris M\u00e9tro is the city's subway system, serving over 5 million passengers daily and is the second-busiest metro system in Europe.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOUVRE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Louvre is the most-visited art museum in the world, known for its extensive collection of art and historical artifacts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNESCO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>UNESCO is a United Nations organization headquartered in Paris, focusing on education, science, and culture.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Paris Saint-Germain is a professional football club based in Paris, known for its success in French and European football.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STADE FRAN\u00c7AIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stade Fran\u00e7ais is a rugby union club based in Paris, contributing to the city's sports culture.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STADE DE FRANCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stade de France is an 81,000-seat stadium located just north of Paris, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup and hosting various major events.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRENCH OPEN<|>EVENT<|>The French Open is an annual Grand Slam tennis tournament held in Paris, known for its red clay courts at Roland Garros.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2024 SUMMER OLYMPICS<|>EVENT<|>The 2024 Summer Olympics is an upcoming international multi-sport event scheduled to be hosted in Paris.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARIS<|>\u00ceLE-DE-FRANCE<|>Paris is the capital city of the \u00cele-de-France region, which encompasses the city and its surrounding areas.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARIS<|>CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT<|>Charles de Gaulle Airport serves as a major international airport for Paris, facilitating global travel.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARIS<|>ORLY AIRPORT<|>Orly Airport is another key international airport serving Paris, contributing to its status as a transport hub.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARIS<|>PARIS M\u00c9TRO<|>The Paris M\u00e9tro is the primary subway system serving the city, essential for urban transportation.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARIS<|>LOUVRE<|>The Louvre is located in Paris and is a significant cultural landmark, attracting millions of visitors.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARIS<|>UNESCO<|>UNESCO is headquartered in Paris, highlighting the city's importance in global culture and education.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARIS<|>PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN<|>Paris Saint-Germain is a prominent football club based in the city, representing Paris in sports.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARIS<|>STADE FRAN\u00c7AIS<|>Stade Fran\u00e7ais is a rugby club located in Paris, contributing to the city's sports culture.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARIS<|>STADE DE FRANCE<|>Stade de France, located near Paris, is a major venue for sports and events, including the FIFA World Cup.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARIS<|>FRENCH OPEN<|>The French Open is held annually in Paris, making the city a key location for international tennis.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARIS<|>2024 SUMMER OLYMPICS<|>Paris is set to host the 2024 Summer Olympics, marking a significant international event for the city.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
