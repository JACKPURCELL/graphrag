With an official estimated population of 2,102,650 residents in January 2023[2] in an area of more than 105 km2 (41 sq mi),[5] Paris is the fourth-largest city in the European Union and the 30th most densely populated city in the world in 2022.[6] Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, culture, fashion, and gastronomy. For its leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its early and extensive system of street lighting, in the 19th century, it became known as the City of Light.[7]\n\nThe City of Paris is the centre of the \u00cele-de-France region, or Paris Region, with an official estimated population of 12,271,794 inhabitants in January 2023, or about 19% of the population of France.[2] The Paris Region had a GDP of \u20ac765 billion (US$1.064 trillion, PPP)[8] in 2021, the highest in the European Union.[9] According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey, in 2022, Paris was the city with the ninth-highest cost of living in the world.[10]\n\nParis is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served by two international airports: Charles de Gaulle Airport, the third-busiest airport in Europe, and Orly Airport.[11][12] Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris M\u00e9tro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily.[13] It is the second-busiest metro system in Europe after the Moscow Metro. Gare du Nord is the 24th-busiest railway station in the world and the busiest outside Japan, with 262 million passengers in 2015.[14] Paris has one of the most sustainable transportation systems[15] and is one of only two cities in the world that received the Sustainable Transport Award twice.[16]\n\nParis is known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the Louvre received 8.9 million visitors in 2023, on track for keeping its position as the most-visited art museum in the world.[17] The Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet and Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist art. The Pompidou Centre Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne, Mus\u00e9e Rodin and Mus\u00e9e Picasso are noted for their collections of modern and contemporary art. The historical district along the Seine in the city centre has been classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1991.[18]\n\nParis is home to several United Nations organizations including UNESCO, as well as other international organizations such as the OECD, the OECD Development Centre, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, the International Energy Agency, the International Federation for Human Rights, along with European bodies such as the European Space Agency, the European Banking Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority. The football club Paris Saint-Germain and the rugby union club Stade Fran\u00e7ais are based in Paris. The 81,000-seat Stade de France, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of Paris in the neighbouring commune of Saint-Denis. Paris hosts the annual French Open Grand Slam tennis tournament on the red clay of Roland Garros. Paris hosted the Olympic Games in 1900 and 1924 and is currently hosting the 2024 Summer Olympics. The 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups, the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, the 2007 Rugby World Cup, as well as the 1960, 1984 and 2016 UEFA European Championships were held in Paris. Every July, the Tour de France bicycle race finishes on the Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PARIS<|>GEO<|>Paris is the capital of France, known for its significant cultural, financial, and historical importance, and is the fourth-largest city in the European Union.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANCE<|>GEO<|>France is a country in Western Europe, of which Paris is the capital and a major center of culture and commerce.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>\u00ceLE-DE-FRANCE<|>GEO<|>\u00cele-de-France is the region that encompasses Paris and has a population of over 12 million inhabitants.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Charles de Gaulle Airport is the third-busiest airport in Europe, serving as a major international transport hub for Paris.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORLY AIRPORT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Orly Airport is one of the two international airports serving Paris, facilitating air transport.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARIS M\u00c9TRO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Paris M\u00e9tro is the city's subway system, serving over 5 million passengers daily and is the second-busiest metro system in Europe.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOUVRE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Louvre is the most-visited art museum in the world, located in Paris, known for its extensive collection of art.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNESCO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>UNESCO is a United Nations organization headquartered in Paris, focusing on education, science, and culture.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Paris Saint-Germain is a professional football club based in Paris, known for its competitive presence in French and European football.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STADE FRAN\u00c7AIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stade Fran\u00e7ais is a rugby union club based in Paris, contributing to the city's sports culture.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STADE DE FRANCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stade de France is an 81,000-seat stadium located just north of Paris, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRENCH OPEN<|>EVENT<|>The French Open is an annual Grand Slam tennis tournament held in Paris at Roland Garros.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2024 SUMMER OLYMPICS<|>EVENT<|>The 2024 Summer Olympics is an upcoming international multi-sport event hosted in Paris.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOUR DE FRANCE<|>EVENT<|>The Tour de France is an annual men's multiple stage bicycle race that traditionally finishes on the Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARIS<|>FRANCE<|>Paris is the capital city of France, making it a central part of the country's identity and governance.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARIS<|>\u00ceLE-DE-FRANCE<|>Paris is the center of the \u00cele-de-France region, which includes the city and its surrounding areas.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT<|>PARIS<|>Charles de Gaulle Airport serves as a major international gateway to Paris, facilitating global travel.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORLY AIRPORT<|>PARIS<|>Orly Airport is another key international airport serving the city of Paris, enhancing its connectivity.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARIS M\u00c9TRO<|>PARIS<|>The Paris M\u00e9tro is an essential public transport system within Paris, serving millions of residents and visitors.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOUVRE<|>PARIS<|>The Louvre is a prominent cultural institution located in Paris, attracting millions of visitors each year.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNESCO<|>PARIS<|>UNESCO is headquartered in Paris, making the city a significant center for international cultural and educational initiatives.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN<|>PARIS<|>Paris Saint-Germain is a major football club based in Paris, contributing to the city's sports culture.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STADE FRAN\u00c7AIS<|>PARIS<|>Stade Fran\u00e7ais is a rugby club located in Paris, playing a key role in the city's sports scene.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STADE DE FRANCE<|>PARIS<|>Stade de France is a major stadium located just outside Paris, hosting significant sporting events.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRENCH OPEN<|>PARIS<|>The French Open is a prestigious tennis tournament held annually in Paris, showcasing the city's role in international sports.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>2024 SUMMER OLYMPICS<|>PARIS<|>The 2024 Summer Olympics will be hosted in Paris, marking a significant global sporting event for the city.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOUR DE FRANCE<|>PARIS<|>The Tour de France traditionally finishes in Paris, highlighting the city's importance in the cycling world.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
